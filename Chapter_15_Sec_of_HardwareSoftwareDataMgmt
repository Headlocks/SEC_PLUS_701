## Chapter 15: Security Implications of Hardware, Software, and Data Asset Management

### Acquisition/Procurement Process
- Acquiring hardware, software, and data assets in accordance with standards for security and compliance
  - Requires collaboration across departments
  - Elements of a procurement review
    - Vendor assessment
    - Product security standards
    - Product licensing and support
    - Cost to keep the asset secure

### Third-Party Risk Management (TRPM)
- Involves evaluating and managing risks associated with outsourcing services and buying products from third-party vendors
  - Perform due diligence before choosing third parties
    - Security policies
    - Track records
    - Compliance with industry standards

### Assignment/Accounting
- Establishes accountability and responsibility for each asset (hardware, software, or data)
  - Ownership
    - Designates individuals or departments responsible for assets from acquisition to decommissioning
  - Classification
    - Tags assets according to sensitivity and importance; sets the security level

### Monitoring/Asset Tracking
- Provides ongoing knowledge of asset location, status, and condition
  - Inventory
    - Detailed record of all organizational assets
  - Enumeration
    - A map of inventoried assets' relationships and dependencies

### Disposal/Decommissioning
#### Decommissioning
- Appropriately disposing of hardware, software, or data assets at the end of their useful tenure
  - Assets may contain sensitive information
  - Industries have strict regulations (HIPAA, SOX) mandating specific disposal procedures
  - Electronic waste can be hazardous

#### Sanitization
- Removing data from storage device to prevent recovery, typically by overwriting existing data with random information
  - Crucial during decommissioning to ensure no residual data is accessible
- Different levels of sanitization
  - For highly sensitive data, multiple passes of sanitization may be used in combination with physical destruction

#### Destruction
- Involves physically disassembling or obliterating hardware assets
  - Shredding
    - Shreds devices into small fragments
  - Degaussing
    - Applies a magnetic field to disrupt data
  - Incineration
    - Burns hardware in a controlled environment
  - Crushing
    - Uses a hydraulic press to deform the device
  - Drilling
    - Drills holes through hard drive platters
  - Acid bath
    - Immerses asset in a corrosive liquid to dissolve parts

### Certification
- Documentation and validation of the disposal and decommissioning process
  - Ensure compliance with company policy and relevant laws or regulations
  - Certificate of destruction serves as a legally binding document confirming secure and responsible disposal of assets

### Data Retention
- Keeping specific types of information for a designated period
  - Mandated by company policy or regulations
  - Data must remain secure and accessible only to authorized personnel during the retention period
  - Upon expiration of the retention period, files should be sanitized or destroyed according to company and legal guidelines
