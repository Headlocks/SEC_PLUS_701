## Chapter 15: Security Implications of Hardware, Software, and Data Asset Management

Acquisition/Procurement Process
  - Acquiring hardware, software, and data assets in accordance with standards for security and compliance
    - requires collaboration across departments
    - elements of a procurement review
      - vendor assessment
      - product security standards
      - product licensing and support
      - cost to keep the asset secure

Third-Party Risk Management (TRPM)
  - Involves evaluating and managing risks associated with outsourcing services and buying products from third-party vendors
    - perform due diligence before choosing third parties
      - security policies
      - track records
      - compliance with industry standards

Assignment/Accounting
  - Establishes acountability and responsibility for each asset (hardware, software, or data)
    - ownership
      - designates individuals or departments responsible for assets from acquisition to decommisioning
    - classification
      - tags assets according to sensitivity and importance; sets the security level

monitoring/asset tracking
  - provides ongoing knowledge of asset location, status, and condition
    - inventory
      - detailed record of all organizational assets
    - enumeration
      - a map of inventoried assets' relationships and dependencies

Disposal/Decommisioning
  Decommissioning
    - appropriately disposing of hardware, software, or data assets at the end of their useful tenure
      - assets may contain sensitive information
      - industries have strict regulations (HIPAA, SOX) mandating specific disposal procedures
      - electronic waste can be hazardous

Sanitization
  - removing data from storage device to prevent recovery, typically by overwriting existing data with random information
    - crucial during decommissioning to ensure no residual data is accessible
  - diferent levels of sanitization
    - for highly sensitive data, multiple passes of sanitization may be used in combination with physical destruction

destruction  
  - involves physically disassembling or obliterating hardware assets
    - shredding
      - shreds devices into small fragments
    - degaussing
      - applies a magnetic field to disrupt data
    - incineration
      - burns hardware in a controlled environment
    - crushing
      - uses a hydraulic press to deform the device
    - drilling
      - drills holes through hard drive platters
    - acid bath
      - immerses asset ina  corrosive liquid to dissolve parts

certification
  - documentation and validation of the disposal and decommissioning process
    - ensure compliance with company policy and relevant laws or regulations
    - certificate of destruction serves as a legally binding document confirming secure and responsible disposal of assets

Data retention
  - keeping specific types of information for a designated period
    - mandated by company policy or regulations
    - data must remain secure and accessible only to authorized personnel during the retention period
    - upon expiration of the retention period, files should be sanitized or destroyed according to company and legal guidelines
