## Chapter 25: Understanding the Processes Associated with Third-Party Risk Assessment and Management

Vendor Assessment
  - evaluating a vendor to ensure they meet organizational requirements before engaging in a business relationship
  - contracts can help protect the organization
    - Service Level Agreement (SLA)
      - defines each party's responsibilities, including vendor's protocol in case of service failure
    - business partners agreement (BPA)
      - defines each party's responsibilities, the profit arrangement, and exit strategies

penetration testing
  - simulating cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities
    - can be used to test a vendors security
      - unknown environment tests
      - known environment tests
      - partially known environment tests

right-to-audit clause
  - grants one party the authority to conduct audits on another to ensure compliance with specific criteria
    - fosters transparency and accountability
    - scope and types of audit permitted should be clearly defined
    - may be invoked in case of suspected non-compliance or following a security incident involving the vendor

evidence of internal audits
  - documentation and findings of audits conducted within the vendor's organization
    - evidence may include audit reports, corrective action plans, and compliance certificates
    - evaluates compliance with legal requirements and internal policies
    - focus could be finances, security, or operations
    - essential when evaluating a vendor's risk

independent assessments
  - evaluation by a third party not directly involved in a vendor's business operations
    - provides an unbiased view of the vendor's compliance and risk management status
    - examples
      - SOC 2 reports
      - ISO certifications
      - results of third-party penetration tests

supply chain analysis
  - thoroughly evaluating every element and process in a vendor's supply chain
    - weak links can expose the organization to risks
    - tools and techniques
      - supplier audits
      - SWOT analysis
      - Data analytics
      - Machine learning predictions

vendor selection
  - evaluating and choosing a third-party service or product provider that best aligns with an organization's needs, goals, and risk tolerance
    - due diligence
      - a comprehensive appraisal of a vendor's business practices, financial stability, reputation, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations
    - conflict of interest
      - a vendor's competing professional or personal interests could interfere with their ability to act in the best interests of the organization

Agreement Types
  - service-level agreement (SLA)
    - defines the expected level of service from a service provider
  - memorandum of agreement (MOA)
    - specifies a cooperative, generally non-legally binding relationship
  - Memorandum of understanding (MOU)
    - less formal than an MOA, it oultines mutual roles and responsibilities in a project or partnership
  - master service agreement (MSA)
    - parties agree to most of the terms that will govern future projects
  - work order/statement of work (WO/SOW)
    - describes work activities, deliverables, and timeline
  - non-disclosure agreement (NDA)
    - legally binding contract establishing a confidential relationship; involves sensitive information
  - business partners agreement (BPA)
    - outlines terms and conditions of a partnership

vendor monitoring
  - continuous oversight and evaluation of vendors to ensure they meet or exceed contractual obligations
    - covers various areas such as reliability, data protection, and ethical considerations (Labor practices)
    - periodic reviews assess vendors' capabilities in response to evolving regulations and emerging threats

questionnaires
  - vendor questionnaires
    - forms used to gather nuanced information about a vendor's operational resilience, data handling practices, and corporate culture
      - probe topics such as
        - data encryption
        - multifactor authentication
        - incident response

rules of engagement
  - agreed-upon guidelines dictating how activities and interactions should occur between an organization and a vendor
    - ensure clear expectations and responsibilities
    - procedures for:
      - security vulnerability reporting
      - escalating issues
      - changing the service provided
