## Chapter 18: Modifying Enterprise Capabilities to Enhance Security

Firewall
  - is a network security device or software that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic
    - firewall rules
      - control the flow of data packets
    - access control lists (ACLs)
      - gover how traffic flows through ports
    - ports
      - are virtual docks where network services can receive data
    - protocols
      - are rules and conventions governing data transmission and acceptance
    - screened subnet
      - is a segment that separates the internal network from an internal network (the internet)

IDS/IPS
  - Intrustion Detection Sysetems (IDSs)
    - monitor and issue alerts about suspicious activities.
  - Intrustion Protection Systems (IPSs)
    - proactive; they block known or potential threats
      - these systems use predefined Signatures( such as specific strings of data) to identify threats. However, known signatures could become irrelevant as new variants of malware emerge
      - Trends identified in analyses of logs can indicate the presence of new vulnerabilities

Web Filter
  - controls access to websites or specific web content based on predefined criteria
    - agent-based web filtering
      - deploys software directly onto individual user devices
    - centralized proxy
      - can serve as an intermediary between user devices and the internet
    - reputation-based filtering 
      - blocks or allows websites based on their histories

Operating System Security
  - is the first line of defense against unauthorized access and malicious attacks
    - group policy
      - created by system administrators to establish detailed rules (policies) for OS and application behavior
    - SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)
      - uses mandatory access controls to restrict the actions of users and system processes

Implementation of Secure Protocols
  - refers to creating encrypted pathways for communication
    - protocol selection
      - choosing the appropriate communication standard for data exchange (HTTPS)
    - Port Selection
      - choosing specific entry and exit points (ports) in the network for data
    - transport method selection
      - choosing a method of securely transporting data packets across the network

DNS Filtering
  - the practice of blocking access to specific websites, web pages, or IP addresses
    - crucial for preventing access to malicious or inappropriate sites
    - users might attempt to bypass with VPNs or other methods

Email Security
  - involves measures used to secure the access and content of email account or services
    - Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)
      - helps receivers verify the authenticity of emails from specific domains
    - DMARC Process
      - SPF check
      - DKIM check
      - DMARC policy retrieval
      - Policy enforcement
      - Reporting

File integrity monitoring
  - involves the regular checking of files for changes or alterations
    - alerts administrators to the unauthorized access or modification of files
    - false positives are a challenge; many authorized changes could be flagged as suspicious

Data Loss Prevention (DLP)  
  - is a comprehensive approach to preventing users from sending sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network
    - describes software products that let network administrators control data access and transfer  
    - alerts administrators to unauthorized data transfer attempts
    - aids in incident response

Network Access Control (NAC)
  - is a method to enforce policy-driven security solutions at the network entry level
    - checks if devices comply with predefined security rules before granting access to the network
    - drawbacks
      - adds complexity to network administration
      - can be circumvented, compromising network security

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)/ Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
  - EDR systems
    - monitor endpoints such as desktop computers, laptops, and mobile deviecs
    - detect and response to signs of malicious activites
  - XDR systems
    - take holistic view of network security, correlating data across various channels and layers like email, cloud, and network traffic
    - identify complex, multi-stage attacks that may evade EDR systems

user behavior analystics
  - use machine learning algorithms to track, collect, and assess user behavior on a network
    - analytics help IT detect unusual activity that could indicate security threats, such as sudden changes in file access patterns
    - alert tuning is important to avoid excessive false positives
