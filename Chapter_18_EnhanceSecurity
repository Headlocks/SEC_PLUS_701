## Chapter 18: Modifying Enterprise Capabilities to Enhance Security

### Firewall
- A firewall is a network security device or software that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic.
  - **Firewall rules**: Control the flow of data packets.
  - **Access control lists (ACLs)**: Govern how traffic flows through ports.
  - **Ports**: Virtual docks where network services can receive data.
  - **Protocols**: Rules and conventions governing data transmission and acceptance.
  - **Screened subnet**: A segment that separates the internal network from an external network (the internet).
  - **stateless firewall**: reliant on pre-configured rules
  - **statefull firewall**: remembers information and adapts

### IDS/IPS
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)**: Monitor and issue alerts about suspicious activities.
- **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs)**: Proactive; they block known or potential threats.
  - These systems use predefined signatures (such as specific strings of data) to identify threats. However, known signatures could become irrelevant as new variants of malware emerge.
  - Trends identified in analyses of logs can indicate the presence of new vulnerabilities.

### Web Filter
- Controls access to websites or specific web content based on predefined criteria.
  - **Agent-based web filtering**: Deploys software directly onto individual user devices.
  - **Centralized proxy**: Can serve as an intermediary between user devices and the internet.
  - **Reputation-based filtering**: Blocks or allows websites based on their histories.

### Operating System Security
- The first line of defense against unauthorized access and malicious attacks.
  - **Group policy**: Created by system administrators to establish detailed rules (policies) for OS and application behavior.
  - **SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)**: Uses mandatory access controls to restrict the actions of users and system processes.

### Implementation of Secure Protocols
- Refers to creating encrypted pathways for communication.
  - **Protocol selection**: Choosing the appropriate communication standard for data exchange (e.g., HTTPS).
  - **Port selection**: Choosing specific entry and exit points (ports) in the network for data.
  - **Transport method selection**: Choosing a method of securely transporting data packets across the network.

### DNS Filtering
- The practice of blocking access to specific websites, web pages, or IP addresses.
  - Crucial for preventing access to malicious or inappropriate sites.
  - Users might attempt to bypass with VPNs or other methods.

### Email Security
- Involves measures used to secure the access and content of email accounts or services.
  - **Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)**: Helps receivers verify the authenticity of emails from specific domains.
  - **DMARC Process**:
    - SPF check
    - DKIM check
    - DMARC policy retrieval
    - Policy enforcement
    - Reporting

### File Integrity Monitoring
- Involves the regular checking of files for changes or alterations.
  - Alerts administrators to unauthorized access or modification of files.
  - False positives are a challenge; many authorized changes could be flagged as suspicious.

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- A comprehensive approach to preventing users from sending sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network.
  - Describes software products that let network administrators control data access and transfer.
  - Alerts administrators to unauthorized data transfer attempts.
  - Aids in incident response.

### Network Access Control (NAC)
- A method to enforce policy-driven security solutions at the network entry level.
  - Checks if devices comply with predefined security rules before granting access to the network.
  - Drawbacks:
    - Adds complexity to network administration.
    - Can be circumvented, compromising network security.

### Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) / Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
- **EDR systems**: Monitor endpoints such as desktop computers, laptops, and mobile devices; detect and respond to signs of malicious activities.
- **XDR systems**: Take a holistic view of network security, correlating data across various channels and layers like email, cloud, and network traffic.
  - Identify complex, multi-stage attacks that may evade EDR systems.

### User Behavior Analytics
- Use machine learning algorithms to track, collect, and assess user behavior on a network.
  - Analytics help IT detect unusual activity that could indicate security threats, such as sudden changes in file access patterns.
  - Alert tuning is important to avoid excessive false positives.
