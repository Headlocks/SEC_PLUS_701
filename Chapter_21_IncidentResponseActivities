## Chapter 21: Understanding Appropriate Incident Response Activities

Incident Response Process
  - Four Phases of the NIST incident Response Lifecycle
    - Preparation
    - Detection and Analysis
    - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
    - Post-Incident Activity

Preparation
  - Creates the plan for responding to and reocvering from security incidents
    - designating a plan owner
    - tech preparation
    - training programs

detection and analysis
  - are accomplished with a mix of automated monitoring and human expertise
    - early detection is best. and early indicator of compromise (IoC) might be unusual network traffic or multiple failed logins
    - analyze the IoC to understand the nature and scope of the threat

containment, eradication, and recovery
  - containment
    - involves isolating the threat from the rest of the network
      - short-term or long-term
  - eradication
    - involves completely removing the threat
      - ensure affected systems are backed up, then reimage
      - apply patches and change password
  - recovery
    - involves choosing a restoration point and validating the systme
      - increase monitoring for 30+ days following incident 

post-incident activity
  - is the "lessons learned" phase of incident response
    - meet within two weeks
    - complete documentation about the incident
    - discuss the response process
    - change the response process if needed

training
  - equips teams with the knowledge and protocols for effectively managing security incidents
    - role-based training for individuals and departments
    - tabletop exercises and simulations for practice responding

testing
  - the rigorous examination of incident response procedures, plans, and capabilities
    - ensures effectiveness of cybersecurity incident response  
    - identifies gaps in responding; serves as a feedback loop for refinement of response strategies

tabletop exercises
  - simulate hypothetical situations that mirror real-world threats
    - each particpant plays a role
      - corresponding to their actual emergency responsibilities
  - time pressure
    - helps simulate the urgency of real incidents
  - decision points
    - pause the action for strategic discussions about how to proceed
  - detailed records
    - are kept of every action, decision, and discussion point

simulation exercises
  - build upon tabletop exercises with simulated tech environments such as sandboxed or isolated replicas of networks
  - tips for conducting a simulation
    - define key peformance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate response effectiveness
    - introduce unexpected elements (power outages) to test the team's adaptability
    - include a post-exercise discussion to identify gaps and discuss improvements

root cause analysis
  - is critical for identifying the reasons udnerlying security incidents
    - data collection
    - timeline analysis
    - hypothesis development
    - hypthesis confirmation or rejection

threat hunting
  - is a proactive search through networks and data sets to detect and isolate advanced theats
    - targets threats that evade traditional reactive security measures
    - involves setting a specific type of threat, such as lateral moves or data exfiltration
    - discoveries may lead to threat remediation and updated security measures

digital forensics
  - is a multidisciplinary approach to collecting, analyzing, and preserving data
    - involves the electronic data relevant to investigations or legal proceedings
    - combines technical expertise with legal frameworks and ethical considerations

legal hold and chain of custody
  - legal hold
    - is the process of preserving electronic evidence related to a legal case or investigation. it prevents the alteration or deletion of specific data.
  - chain custody
    - documents the path that evidence takes from acquisition to disposal
      - helps ensure integrity and admissibility of evidence in legal proceedings

acquisition
  - is the systematic collection of digital evidence meant to maintain its authenticity
    - follows the order of volatility; captures the most volatile data first (CPU cache and registers)
    - uses special tools to capture RAM
    - create a bit-by-bit image of the hard drive
    - captures network traffic and logs
    - looks for suspicious artificats (residual data) such as changes in system settings

reporting
  - is the documenting of activities and findings throughout the forensic process
    - serves as a record for internal review and may become critical evidence in legal proceedings
    - elements ofa  well-structured report
      - timeline of events
      - tools used
      - evidence found
      - steps taken

preservation
  - involves safeguarding evidence from identificiation to the end of its lifecycle
    - secure, climate-controlled environment
    - tamper-evident storage

E-Discovery
  - involves identifying, collecting, and producing electronically stored information in response to a legal request
    - subject to specific rules and protocols
    - uses specialized software for searching, identifying, and collecting electronic information
    - ensures that collected information is relevant and not privileged before production
