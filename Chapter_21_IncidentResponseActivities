## Chapter 21: Understanding Appropriate Incident Response Activities

### Incident Response Process
- **Four Phases of the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Incident Response Lifecycle**
  - Preparation
  - Detection and Analysis
  - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
  - Post-Incident Activity

### Preparation
- Creates the plan for responding to and recovering from security incidents
  - Designating a plan owner
  - Technical preparation
  - Training programs

### Detection and Analysis
- Accomplished with a mix of automated monitoring and human expertise
  - Early detection is best. An early indicator of compromise (IoC) might be unusual network traffic or multiple failed logins
  - Analyze the IoC to understand the nature and scope of the threat

### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
- **Containment**
  - Involves isolating the threat from the rest of the network
    - Short-term or long-term
- **Eradication**
  - Involves completely removing the threat
    - Ensure affected systems are backed up, then reimage
    - Apply patches and change passwords
- **Recovery**
  - Involves choosing a restoration point and validating the system
    - Increase monitoring for 30+ days following the incident

### Post-Incident Activity
- The "lessons learned" phase of incident response
  - Meet within two weeks
  - Complete documentation about the incident
  - Discuss the response process
  - Change the response process if needed

### Training
- Equips teams with the knowledge and protocols for effectively managing security incidents
  - Role-based training for individuals and departments
  - Tabletop exercises and simulations for practice responding

### Testing
- The rigorous examination of incident response procedures, plans, and capabilities
  - Ensures effectiveness of cybersecurity incident response  
  - Identifies gaps in responding; serves as a feedback loop for refinement of response strategies

### Tabletop Exercises
- Simulate hypothetical situations that mirror real-world threats
  - Each participant plays a role
    - Corresponding to their actual emergency responsibilities
  - Time pressure
    - Helps simulate the urgency of real incidents
  - Decision points
    - Pause the action for strategic discussions about how to proceed
  - Detailed records
    - Are kept of every action, decision, and discussion point

### Simulation Exercises
- Build upon tabletop exercises with simulated tech environments such as sandboxed or isolated replicas of networks
- **Tips for Conducting a Simulation**
  - Define key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate response effectiveness
  - Introduce unexpected elements (e.g., power outages) to test the team's adaptability
  - Include a post-exercise discussion to identify gaps and discuss improvements

### Root Cause Analysis
- Critical for identifying the reasons underlying security incidents
  - Data collection
  - Timeline analysis
  - Hypothesis development
  - Hypothesis confirmation or rejection

### Threat Hunting
- A proactive search through networks and data sets to detect and isolate advanced threats
  - Targets threats that evade traditional reactive security measures
  - Involves setting a specific type of threat, such as lateral moves or data exfiltration
  - Discoveries may lead to threat remediation and updated security measures

### Digital Forensics
- A multidisciplinary approach to collecting, analyzing, and preserving data
  - Involves the electronic data relevant to investigations or legal proceedings
  - Combines technical expertise with legal frameworks and ethical considerations

### Legal Hold and Chain of Custody
- **Legal Hold**
  - The process of preserving electronic evidence related to a legal case or investigation. It prevents the alteration or deletion of specific data.
- **Chain of Custody**
  - Documents the path that evidence takes from acquisition to disposal
    - Helps ensure integrity and admissibility of evidence in legal proceedings

### Acquisition
- The systematic collection of digital evidence meant to maintain its authenticity
  - Follows the order of volatility; captures the most volatile data first (e.g., CPU cache and registers)
  - Uses special tools to capture RAM
  - Creates a bit-by-bit image of the hard drive
  - Captures network traffic and logs
  - Looks for suspicious artifacts (residual data) such as changes in system settings

### Reporting
- The documenting of activities and findings throughout the forensic process
  - Serves as a record for internal review and may become critical evidence in legal proceedings
  - Elements of a well-structured report:
    - Timeline of events
    - Tools used
    - Evidence found
    - Steps taken

### Preservation
- Involves safeguarding evidence from identification to the end of its lifecycle
  - Secure, climate-controlled environment
  - Tamper-evident storage

### E-Discovery
- Involves identifying, collecting, and producing electronically stored information in response to a legal request
  - Subject to specific rules and protocols
  - Uses specialized software for searching, identifying, and collecting electronic information
  - Ensures that collected information is relevant and not privileged before production
