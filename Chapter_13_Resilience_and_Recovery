High Availability (HA)
  - ensure that a system or application remains accessible and operational over an extended period
    - redundant hardware
      - multiple instances of critical hardware components eliminate single points of failure
    - automated backups
      - regularly scheduled backups are automated to ensure that the most recent data is always available for recovery
    - failover mechanims
      - configuration allows the system or network to switch to a standby system or network automatically if the primary one fails

cloud environments
  - in cloud computing, availability is often determined by the storage class
    - different availability metrics influence costs
    - storage class selection should be based on a thorough risk analysis
    - recommendation: select applications with greater storage availability for mission-critical uses

site considerations
  - hot site
    - a near duplicate of the organizations original site that can be up and running within minutes
  - warm site
    - contains computers, phones, and servers but may require configuration before use
  - cold site
    - provides basic office infrastructure, but extensive computer configuration and data restoration would be needed before use
  - geographically distant site
    - computing environment, such as a data center, located at least 50 miles from the main compute campus data center

platform diversity
  - is the implementation of varied hardware or software platforms within an organizations IT environment
    - reduces systemic risks associated with a single point of failure
    - benefits
      - reslience: increased ability to withstand security incidents and technical failures
      - enhanced recovery: improved capacity to recover from incidents due to diversified platforms

multi-cloud system
  - involves using multiple cloud service platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) to fulfill diverse computational and storage needs
    - reduces dependency on a single cloud service provider
    - benefits
      - risk mitigation
      - high availability
      - robust disaster recovery

continuity of operations
  - is a federal initiative encouraging organizations to plan for the continuation of critical operations under various emergency circumstances
  - procedures in a cointinuity plan
    - alerting, activating, notifying, and deploying employees
    - identifying critical business functions
    - establishing an alternative facility or work-from-home process
    - creating a roster of personnel with authority and knowledge of business operational functions

capacity planning
  - is the process of determining future resource requirements such as people, technology, and infrastructure
    - considerations
      - people: staffing requirements to maintain and operate systems efficiently
      - technology: computational power, software, and hardware needed to meet future demands
      - infrastructure: physical or virtual resources to support technology and personnel

testing
  - tabletop exercises
    - validate and improve incident response plans (IRPs) through real-life scenario simulations
    - gauge team performance against predefined questions and scenarios
  - failover testing
    - involves switching operational functions from primary to secondary systems to assess continuity during system failures
    - tests redundancy mechanisms and contingency plans
  - simulations
    - provides structured exercises to practice incident response procedures in simulated realistic scenarios
    - helps identify deficiencies, improve response capabilities, and validate readiness
  - parallel processing
    - runs same tasks concurrently in primary and secondary systems
    - verifies backup systems operational reliability and accuracy

backups
  - duplicate copy of data and system configurations stored separately from the original
    - types of backups
      - full backup
      - incremental backup
      - differential backup
      - mirror backup
      - continuous data protection (CDP)
      - cloud backup
      - virtual backup
      - bare-metal backup

power management
  - involves provisioning, controlling, and efficientlly utilizing electricity to maintain uninterrupted facility operation
    - uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
      - offer emergency power during main power failures by storing energy in batteries or supercapacitors
    - generators
      - supply power during complete power loss or in areas without standard electrical service, converting mechanical or chemical energy into electrical energy
