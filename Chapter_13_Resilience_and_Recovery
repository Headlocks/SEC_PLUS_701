# High Availability (HA)
- Ensure that a system or application remains accessible and operational over an extended period
  - Redundant hardware
    - Multiple instances of critical hardware components eliminate single points of failure
  - Automated backups
    - Regularly scheduled backups are automated to ensure that the most recent data is always available for recovery
  - Failover mechanisms
    - Configuration allows the system or network to switch to a standby system or network automatically if the primary one fails

# Cloud Environments
- In cloud computing, availability is often determined by the storage class
  - Different availability metrics influence costs
  - Storage class selection should be based on a thorough risk analysis
  - Recommendation: select applications with greater storage availability for mission-critical uses

# Site Considerations
- Hot site
  - A near duplicate of the organization’s original site that can be up and running within minutes
- Warm site
  - Contains computers, phones, and servers but may require configuration before use
- Cold site
  - Provides basic office infrastructure, but extensive computer configuration and data restoration would be needed before use
- Geographically distant site
  - Computing environment, such as a data center, located at least 50 miles from the main compute campus data center

# Platform Diversity
- Implementation of varied hardware or software platforms within an organization’s IT environment
  - Reduces systemic risks associated with a single point of failure
  - Benefits
    - Resilience: increased ability to withstand security incidents and technical failures
    - Enhanced recovery: improved capacity to recover from incidents due to diversified platforms

# Multi-Cloud System
- Involves using multiple cloud service platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) to fulfill diverse computational and storage needs
  - Reduces dependency on a single cloud service provider
  - Benefits
    - Risk mitigation
    - High availability
    - Robust disaster recovery

# Continuity of Operations
- A federal initiative encouraging organizations to plan for the continuation of critical operations under various emergency circumstances
  - Procedures in a continuity plan
    - Alerting, activating, notifying, and deploying employees
    - Identifying critical business functions
    - Establishing an alternative facility or work-from-home process
    - Creating a roster of personnel with authority and knowledge of business operational functions

# Capacity Planning
- The process of determining future resource requirements such as people, technology, and infrastructure
  - Considerations
    - People: staffing requirements to maintain and operate systems efficiently
    - Technology: computational power, software, and hardware needed to meet future demands
    - Infrastructure: physical or virtual resources to support technology and personnel

# Testing
- Tabletop exercises
  - Validate and improve incident response plans (IRPs) through real-life scenario simulations
  - Gauge team performance against predefined questions and scenarios
- Failover testing
  - Involves switching operational functions from primary to secondary systems to assess continuity during system failures
  - Tests redundancy mechanisms and contingency plans
- Simulations
  - Provide structured exercises to practice incident response procedures in simulated realistic scenarios
  - Help identify deficiencies, improve response capabilities, and validate readiness
- Parallel processing
  - Runs same tasks concurrently in primary and secondary systems
  - Verifies backup systems operational reliability and accuracy

# Backups
- Duplicate copy of data and system configurations stored separately from the original
  - Types of backups
    - Full backup
    - Incremental backup
    - Differential backup (NO archive bit change)
    - Mirror backup
    - Continuous data protection (CDP)
    - Cloud backup
    - Virtual backup
    - Bare-metal backup
    - Snapshot

# Power Management
- Involves provisioning, controlling, and efficiently utilizing electricity to maintain uninterrupted facility operation
  - Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
    - Offers emergency power during main power failures by storing energy in batteries or supercapacitors
  - Generators
    - Supply power during complete power loss or in areas without standard electrical service, converting mechanical or chemical energy into electrical energy
