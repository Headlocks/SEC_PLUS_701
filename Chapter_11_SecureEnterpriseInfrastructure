## Chapter 11: Secure Enterprise Infrastructure

Device Placement
  - is the thoughtful positioning of hardware devices within a network
  considerations
    - security requirements
    - network efficiency
    - accessiblity
  examples
    - place firewalls close to the network perimeter to prevent unauthorized access
    - position snesitive data servers in secure locations to minimize exposure to therats

security zones
  - segregated areas in a network under specific security policies and controls
  internal zones
    - trusted segments in which sensitive or internal data is processed
  external zones
    - areas allowing connections from public internet or other untrusted networks
  screened subnet
    - specialized external zone that isolates public-facing services from the internet
  specialized zones
    - zones designed to meet regulatory compliance requirements

attack surface
  - all the vulnerabilities and potential access points an attacker could use to gain access to the system
  Larger Surface = Greater Risk
  Strategies ot reduce the attack surface
    - turn off unnecessary services
    - close open ports
    - apply patches and updates
    - use firewalls
    - implement strong authentication

connectivity
  - how network, systems, and applications connect and communicate
  security considerations
    - encrypt data in transit
    - secure connection endpoints
    - employ secure protocols
    - use VPNs or firewalls
  remember connectivity when designing new systems with other departments

failure modes
  fail-open configuration    
    - system remains available if a portion fails
  fail-closed configuration
    - entire systems becomes inaccessible if a portion fails
  examples
    - DNS server: may fail open to continue servicing other zones, but the database server may fail closed to protect confidential information
    - firewall: would fail closed to maintain security

device attribute
  - a characteristic determining device operation in a network environment
  active vs passive
    - active/active: devices share workload simultaneously; critical for failover or load balancing
    - active/passive: one device active, another on standby; passive activates if active fails or is manually switches
  inline monitoring vs tap/monitor mode
    - inline monitoring: device is placed idrectly in traffic flow, allowing active intervention
    - tap/monitor mode: device observes traffic without interfering

network appliances
  - essential for network functionality, security, and efficiency
  types of network appliances
    - jump server
    - proxy server
    - Intrustion Prevention System (IPS)/ intrustion detection system (IDS)
    - load balancer
    - sensors

port security
  - is vital for safeguarding network access and preventing unauthorized devices from communicating through network ports
    - 802.1X authentication standard provides port-based network access control
    - EAP is a universal authentication framework that defines message formats. its frequently used with 802.1X

firewall types
  - network security device or software that acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks such as the internet

Virtual Private Network
  - establishes a secure connection between two or more devices over the internet, even if they are not on the same private network

remote access
  - allows authorized users to connect to a network, systems, or application from a location outside the organizations physical premises
  remote access technologies
    - remote access service (RAS)
    - Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
    - Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)
    - Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)

Tunneling
  - creates a secure pathway for data transmission accross networks via encapsulation
    - protocols like Transport Layers Security (TLS) and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) enhance the security of tunneling by providing encryption and integrity mechanisms
    - IKE, the key management protocol for IPsec, has two phases. Phase 1 negotiates the ISAKMP SA, and PHase 2 negotiates the IPsec Sas.

Software-Defined wide area network (SD-WAN)
  - is a networking architecture flexibility by separating control mechanisms from network hardware
  - simplifies network management, improves performance, and enhances reliability

Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)
  - is a cloud-native architecture the merges network security functions with WAN capabilities
    - integrates network and security services into a unified platform, simplifying managaement and ensuring secure access
    - provides secure and seamless access to resources regardless of user location
