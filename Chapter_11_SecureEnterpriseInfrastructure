## Chapter 11: Secure Enterprise Infrastructure

### Device Placement
- Device placement is the thoughtful positioning of hardware devices within a network.

#### Considerations
- Security requirements
- Network efficiency
- Accessibility

#### Examples
- Place firewalls close to the network perimeter to prevent unauthorized access.
- Position sensitive data servers in secure locations to minimize exposure to threats.

### Security Zones
- Security zones are segregated areas in a network under specific security policies and controls.

#### Internal Zones
- Trusted segments in which sensitive or internal data is processed.

#### External Zones
- Areas allowing connections from the public internet or other untrusted networks.

#### Screened Subnet
- Specialized external zone that isolates public-facing services from the internet.

#### Specialized Zones
- Zones designed to meet regulatory compliance requirements.

### Attack Surface
- The attack surface encompasses all the vulnerabilities and potential access points an attacker could use to gain access to the system.
- Larger Surface = Greater Risk

#### Strategies to Reduce the Attack Surface
- Turn off unnecessary services.
- Close open ports.
- Apply patches and updates.
- Use firewalls.
- Implement strong authentication.

### Connectivity
- Connectivity refers to how network, systems, and applications connect and communicate.

#### Security Considerations
- Encrypt data in transit.
- Secure connection endpoints.
- Employ secure protocols.
- Use VPNs or firewalls.

### Failure Modes
#### Fail-Open Configuration
- The system remains available if a portion fails.

#### Fail-Closed Configuration
- The entire system becomes inaccessible if a portion fails.

#### Examples
- DNS server: may fail open to continue servicing other zones, but the database server may fail closed to protect confidential information.
- Firewall: would fail closed to maintain security.

### Device Attributes
- Characteristics determining device operation in a network environment.

#### Active vs Passive
- Active/Active: Devices share workload simultaneously; critical for failover or load balancing.
- Active/Passive: One device active, another on standby; passive activates if active fails or is manually switched.

#### Inline Monitoring vs Tap/Monitor Mode
- Inline Monitoring: Device is placed directly in traffic flow, allowing active intervention.
- Tap/Monitor Mode: Device observes traffic without interfering.

### Network Appliances
- Essential for network functionality, security, and efficiency.

#### Types of Network Appliances
- Jump server
- Proxy server
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) / Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Load balancer
- Sensors

### Port Security
- Vital for safeguarding network access and preventing unauthorized devices from communicating through network ports.
- 802.1X authentication standard provides port-based network access control.
- Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a universal authentication framework that defines message formats. It is frequently used with 802.1X.
  - PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol)
    - adds an encapsulated encrypted layer over EAP with TLS.
  - EAP-FAST
  - EAP-TLS
  - EAP-TTLS

### Firewall Types
- Network security device or software that acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks such as the internet.

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- Establishes a secure connection between two or more devices over the internet, even if they are not on the same private network.

### Remote Access
- Allows authorized users to connect to a network, systems, or application from a location outside the organization's physical premises.

#### Remote Access Technologies
- Remote Access Service (RAS)
- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
- Terminal Access Controller Access Control System Plus (TACACS+)
- Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)

### Tunneling
- Creates a secure pathway for data transmission across networks via encapsulation.
- Protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) enhance the security of tunneling by providing encryption and integrity mechanisms.
- IKE, the key management protocol for IPsec, has two phases. Phase 1 negotiates the ISAKMP SA, and Phase 2 negotiates the IPsec SAs.

### Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN)
- Networking architecture flexibility by separating control mechanisms from network hardware.
- Simplifies network management, improves performance, and enhances reliability.

### Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)
- Cloud-native architecture that merges network security functions with WAN capabilities.
- Integrates network and security services into a unified platform, simplifying management and ensuring secure access.
- Provides secure and seamless access to resources regardless of user location.
