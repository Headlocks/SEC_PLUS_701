## Chapter 8: Indicators of Malicious Activity

### Malware Attacks
- **Malware:**
  - is software designed to infiltrate, damage, or gather information from a system without user consent.
  - Security professionals define and categorize malware to inform preventive measures.
  - When malware is identified, removal or quarantine is crucial.

### Types of Malware Attacks
- **Ransomware:**
  - Restricts access to a computer system and demands payment for decryption. It's often propagated via phishing.
- **Trojans:**
  - Masquerade as legitimate software but perform malicious functions. They're often downloaded unknowingly.
- **Worms:**
  - Self-replicate to spread across networks, exploiting security vulnerabilities in operating systems and applications.
- **Spyware:**
  - Secretly monitors and collects user activity, potentially compromising sensitive information.
- **Bloatware:**
  - Consumes excessive system resources and can hinder system performance.
- **Viruses:**
  - Infect computers when executed by users and spread copies of themselves throughout the system.
- **Keyloggers:**
  - Hardware and software capture keystrokes to steal sensitive data.
- **Logic bombs:**
  - Initiate malicious functions under specific conditions, blurring the line between malware and malware delivery systems.
- **Rootkits:**
  - Gain administrator-level control over computer systems without detection.

### Physical Attacks
- Target tangible components of information systems, such as hardware devices, data storage mediums, and physical locations.
  - Brute force
  - Physical brute force
  - RFID cloning
  - Environmental

### Network Attacks
- Aim to compromise network services and affect data availability, integrity, and confidentiality.
- **DDoS attacks:**
  - Overwhelm target systems with traffic, often by spoofing the victim's IP address.
- **Amplified DDoS attacks:**
  - Send small requests to vulnerable servers that trigger large responses.
- **Reflected DDoS attacks:**
  - Use legitimate services to bounce and redirect traffic to the victim.
- **DNS attacks:**
  - Disrupt the translation of domain names into IP addresses, redirecting users to malicious sites or rendering legitimate sites unavailable.
- **Wireless attacks:**
  - Exploit vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks.
- **On-path attacks:**
  - Intercept communication between two parties and may also alter data.
- **Credential replay:**
  - Involves capturing valid user credentials and reusing them for unauthorized access.
- **Malicious code:**
  - Includes viruses, worms, and trojan horses.

### Application Attacks
- Exploit software application weaknesses, potentially resulting in unauthorized access, data theft, or system disruption.
  - Injection
  - Buffer overflow
  - Replay
  - Privilege escalation
  - Forgery
  - Directory traversal

### Cryptographic Attacks
- Target weak implementations of cryptography.
- **Downgrade attacks:**
  - Force the use of a weaker cryptographic algorithm instead of a stronger one, often leveraging legacy systems with outdated algorithms.
- **Birthday attacks:**
  - Are aimed at producing two messages with the same hash function, resulting in a collision.
- **Collision:**
  - Occurs when two different files produce the same hash value, compromising data integrity.

### Password Attacks
- Are unauthorized attempts to gain access to a system or account by exploiting weaknesses in password security.
- **Password spraying:**
  - Involves trying to compromise a system by attempting many usernames in combination with a few common passwords.
- **Brute-force attacks:**
  - Use random characters and numbers to try to crack passwords.

### Indicators
- Are the behaviors, patterns, and anomalies within a system or a network that may signify unauthorized access, malware infection, or other cyber threats.
- **Account lockout:**
  - Lockouts after failed login attempts could indicate brute-force attacks.
- **Concurrent sessions:**
  - Multiple simultaneous sessions from a single account suggest unauthorized access.
- **Block content:**
  - Increased instances of blocked content signal potential security threats or increased risk exposure.
- **Impossible travel:**
  - Login attempts from geographically distant locations in an unrealistic timeframe suggest compromised credentials.
- **Resource consumption:**
  - Abnormal increases in resource usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) may indicate malware or DDoS attacks.
- **Resource inaccessibility:**
  - The sudden inability to access essential resources like files or databases could signify ransomware or malicious activity.
- **Out-of-cycle logging:**
  - Logging activities outside of normal patterns may indicate intrusion attempts or unauthorized access.
- **Mission logs:**
  - The sudden disappearance or alteration of log files suggests attempts to cover tracks. Regular monitoring is crucial for detection.
- **Published/documented indicators:**
  - Monitoring sources that share known threats can aid in early threat detection.
