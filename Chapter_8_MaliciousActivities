## Chapter 8: Indicators of Malicious Activity

Malware Attacks
  Malware
    - is a software designed to infiltrate, damage, or gather information from a system without user consent.
      - security professionals define and categorize malware to inform preventive measures
      - when malware is identified, removal or quarantine is crucial

Types of Malware Attacks
  Ransomware
    - restricts access to a computer system and demands payment for decryption. its often propagated via phishing.
  Trojans
    - masquerade as legitimate software but perform malicious functions. they're often downloaded unknowingly.
  Worms
    - self-replicate to spread accross networks, exploiting security vulnerabilities in operating systems and applications.
  Spyware
    - secretly monitors and collects user activity, potentially compromising sensitive information
  Bloatware
    - consumes excessive system resources and can hinder system performance
  Viruses
    - infect computers when executed by users and spread copies of themselves throughout the system.
  Keyloggers
    - hardware and software capture keystrokes to steal sensitive data
  Logic bombs
    - initiate malicious functions under specific conditions, blurring the line between malware and malware delivery systems
  Rootkits
    - gain administrator-level control over computer systems wthout detection

Physical Attacks 
  - target tangible components of information systems, such as hardware devices, data storage mediums, and physical locations
    - brute force
    - physical brute force
    - RFID cloning
    - Environmental

Network Attacks
  - aim to compromise network services and affect data availability, integrity, and confidentiality
  DDOS attacks
    - overwhelm target systems with traffic, often by spoofing the victim's IP address
    amplified DDOS attacks
      - send small request to vulnerable servers that trigger large responses
    reflected DDOS attacks
      - use legitimate services to bounce and redirect traffic to the victim
  DNS attacks
    - disrupt the translation of domain names into IP addresses, redirecting users to malicious sites or rendering legitimate sites unavailable
  wireless attacks
    - exploit vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks
  on-path attacks
    - intercept communication between two parties and may also alter data
  credential replay
    - involves capturing valid user credentials and reusing them for unauthorized access
  malicious code
    - includes viruses, worms, and trojan horses

application attacks
  - exploit software application weaknesses, potentially resulting in unauthroized access, data theft, or system disruption
    - injection
    - buffer overflow
    - replay
    - privilege escalation
    - forgery
    - directory traversal

cryptographic attacks
  - target weak implementations of cryptography
    downgrade attacks
      - force the use of a weaker cryptographic algorithm instead of a stronger one, often leveraging legacy systems with outdate algorithms
    birthday attacks
      - are aimed at producing two messages with the same hash function, resulting in collision
    collision
      - occurs when two different files produce the same hash value, compromising data integrity

password attacks
  - are unauthorized attempts to gain access to a asystem or account by exploiting weaknesses in password security
  password spraying
    - involves trying to compromise a system by attempting many usernames in combination with a few common passwors
  brute-force attacks 
    - use random characters and numbers to try to crack passwords

indicators
  - are the behaviors, patterns, and anomalies within a system or a network that may signify unauthorized access, malware infection, or other cyber threats
  account lockout
    - lockouts after failed login attempts could indicate brute-force attacks
  concurrent sessions
    - multiple simultaneous sessions from a single account suggests unauthorized access
  block content
    - increased instances of blocked content signal potential security threats or increased risk exposure
  impossible travel
    - login attempts from geographically distant locations in an unrealistic timeframe suggest compromised credentials
  resource consumption
    - abnormal increases in resource usage (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) may indicate malware or DDoS attacks
  resource inaccessibility
    - the sudden inability to access essential resources like files or databases could signify ransomware or malicious activity
  out-of-cycle logging
    - logging activities outside of nromal patterns may indiicate intrusion attempts or unauthorized access
  mission logs
    - the sudden disappearance or alteration of log files suggests attempts to cover tracks. regular monitoring is crucial for detection
  published/documented indicators
    - monitoring sources that share known threats can aid in early threat detection
