Message-based Communication threats
  - poses significant security risks due ot its widespread use, users' trust in platforms, and the potential for immediate damage
    examples
      -email  
      - Short Message Service (SMS)
      - Instant Messaging (IM)
      - Spam and Spam over Internet Messaging (SPIM)
    Mitigation
      - user training and awareness
      - spam filters
      - secure email gateways

Image-Based threats
  - involve using digital images to exploit vulnerabilities in software and systems
    examples
      - using images in a phishing attack
      - disguising malware as an image file
    mitigation
      - user training and awareness
      - using up-to-date antivirus/anti-malware software

file-based threats
  - leverage common file formats such as .doc and .jpg to conceal harmful scripts and execute malicious activities
    - malicious code is embedded within or attached to these files, which are distributed via email attachments, downloads from websites, and file-sharing services
  mitigation
    - user training and awareness
    - file scanning
    - strict file permissions

voice call threats
  - involve malicious activities conducted through phone calls
    - attackers aim to deceive or manipulate individuals into disclosing information by pretending to be trusted entities
    mitigation
      - user training and awareness
      - secure call authentication
      - report suspicious calls

removable device threats
  - involve using portable storage devices that transmit malware. examples are USB drives, external hard drives, and memory cards.
    - when an infected device connects to a computer, it may execute malicious code and spread malware to connected systems
  mitigation
    - user training and awareness
    - scan devices for malware
    - restrict device use

vulnerable software
  - has exploitable flaws or weaknesses in its code or design
    - two approaches help protect vulnerable software
      - client-based security
        - involves installing software agents on client devices for active monitoring and protection
      - agentless security
        - centralized; it enables monitoring and protection without installing software on individual client devices

Unsecure networks
  - lack appropriate security measures. they expose individuals and organizations to cyber threats such as data theft, unauthorized access, and remote device control.
  wireless networks
    - vulvnerable to unauthorized access and eavesdropping if improperly configured or lacking encryption
  wired networks
    - more secure than wireless networks, but vulnerable without proper segmentation and access controls
  bluetooth networks
    - exploitable if devices are set to "discoverable" mode or if bluetooth vulnerabilities are not patched

open service ports
  - ports are network communication endpoints that are accessible and unguarded
  mitigation
    - firewall configuration
    - port scanning
    - monitoring and logging

default credentials
  - simple default passwords that ship with hardware and software
    - default creds post significant security risks, yet organizations often leave them unchanged
    - credential harvesting exacerbates the problem. attackers post harvested usernames and passwords on platforms like pastebin and github.

supply chain
  - a network of organizations, resources, and processes involved in creating, producing, and delivering products or services.
  managed service providers (MSPs)
    - organizations that manage IT services for other companies, offering efficiency but potentially introducing risks
  vendors
    - companies providing products or services to other businesses
  suppliers
    - providers of raw materials or components used in manufacturing

human vectors & social engineering
  human vectors
    - individuals manipulated into giving access to sensitive information or systems
  social engineering
    - encompasses a broad range of techniques aimed at manipulating the human psyche

types of social engineering attacks
  phishing
    - involves fraudulent attempts to obtain private information by masquerading as someone else
  vishing or voice phishing 
    - involves using voice calls, often over VoIP systems, to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information
  smishing
    - a combination of "SMS" and "phishing," involves sending deceptive SMS messages to trick recipients into clicking malicious links or downloading malware onto their mobile devices
  misinformation
    - refers to false or misleading information tahts spread without malicious intent
  disinformation
    - false or misleading information that is intentionally deceptive
  impersonation
    - involves pretending to be someone else to gain trust or access
  business email compromise (BEC)
    - sophisticated scam that compromises legitimate business email accounts to conduct unauthorized transfers or funds
  pretexting
    - attacker invents a scenario (a pretext) to persuade a victim to divulge information
  watering hole attack
    - attacker load malware onto sites that the targets frequently visit
  brand impersonation
    - involves attackers posing as trusted brands such as banks and technology companies
  typosquatting
    - involves attackers maliciously using domain names that are typo version of legitimate domains
