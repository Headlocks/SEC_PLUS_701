# Chapter 6: Threat Vectors and Attack Surfaces

## Message-based Communication Threats
- Pose significant security risks due to its widespread use, users' trust in platforms, and the potential for immediate damage.
  - Examples:
    - Email
    - Short Message Service (SMS)
    - Instant Messaging (IM)
    - Spam and Spam over Internet Messaging (SPIM)
  - Mitigation:
    - User training and awareness
    - Spam filters
    - Secure email gateways

## Image-Based Threats
- Involve using digital images to exploit vulnerabilities in software and systems.
  - Examples:
    - Using images in a phishing attack
    - Disguising malware as an image file
  - Mitigation:
    - User training and awareness
    - Using up-to-date antivirus/anti-malware software

## File-Based Threats
- Leverage common file formats such as .doc and .jpg to conceal harmful scripts and execute malicious activities.
  - Malicious code is embedded within or attached to these files, which are distributed via email attachments, downloads from websites, and file-sharing services.
  - Mitigation:
    - User training and awareness
    - File scanning
    - Strict file permissions

## Voice Call Threats
- Involve malicious activities conducted through phone calls.
  - Attackers aim to deceive or manipulate individuals into disclosing information by pretending to be trusted entities.
  - Mitigation:
    - User training and awareness
    - Secure call authentication
    - Report suspicious calls

## Removable Device Threats
- Involve using portable storage devices that transmit malware. Examples are USB drives, external hard drives, and memory cards.
  - When an infected device connects to a computer, it may execute malicious code and spread malware to connected systems.
  - Mitigation:
    - User training and awareness
    - Scan devices for malware
    - Restrict device use

## Vulnerable Software
- Has exploitable flaws or weaknesses in its code or design.
  - Two approaches help protect vulnerable software:
    - Client-based security:
      - Involves installing software agents on client devices for active monitoring and protection.
    - Agentless security:
      - Centralized; it enables monitoring and protection without installing software on individual client devices.

## Unsupported Systems and Applications
- Software tools or platforms lacking regular updates, security patches, or technical support from developers or vendors.
  - May occur when software reaches its official end-of-life (EOL) or a company goes out of business.
  - Unaddressed vulnerabilities are prime targets for cybercriminals.

## Unsecure Networks
- Lack appropriate security measures. They expose individuals and organizations to cyber threats such as data theft, unauthorized access, and remote device control.
  - Wireless networks:
    - Vulnerable to unauthorized access and eavesdropping if improperly configured or lacking encryption.
  - Wired networks:
    - More secure than wireless networks, but vulnerable without proper segmentation and access controls.
  - Bluetooth networks:
    - Exploitable if devices are set to "discoverable" mode or if Bluetooth vulnerabilities are not patched.

## Open Service Ports
- Ports are network communication endpoints that are accessible and unguarded.
  - Mitigation:
    - Firewall configuration
    - Port scanning
    - Monitoring and logging

## Default Credentials
- Simple default passwords that ship with hardware and software.
  - Default credentials pose significant security risks, yet organizations often leave them unchanged.
  - Credential harvesting exacerbates the problem. Attackers post harvested usernames and passwords on platforms like Pastebin and GitHub.

## Supply Chain
- A network of organizations, resources, and processes involved in creating, producing, and delivering products or services.
  - Managed Service Providers (MSPs):
    - Organizations that manage IT services for other companies, offering efficiency but potentially introducing risks.
  - Vendors:
    - Companies providing products or services to other businesses.
  - Suppliers:
    - Providers of raw materials or components used in manufacturing.

## Human Vectors & Social Engineering
### Human Vectors
- Individuals manipulated into giving access to sensitive information or systems.

### Social Engineering
- Encompasses a broad range of techniques aimed at manipulating the human psyche.

### Types of Social Engineering Attacks
- Phishing:
  - Involves fraudulent attempts to obtain private information by masquerading as someone else.
- Vishing or Voice Phishing:
  - Involves using voice calls, often over VoIP systems, to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information.
- Smishing:
  - A combination of "SMS" and "phishing," involves sending deceptive SMS messages to trick recipients into clicking malicious links or downloading malware onto their mobile devices.
- Skimming:
  - involve the unauthorized capture of sensitive information, such as payment data or credit card details, through various illicit methods
- Shimming:
  - It is a form of malicious software designed to bypass security measures and gain access to the system, often used to steal data or gain access to sensitive information. 
  - Works by inserting malicious code into a legitimate process or application. The shim typically operates at the kernel level, making it difficult to detect.
- Misinformation:
  - Refers to false or misleading information that's spread without malicious intent.
- Disinformation:
  - False or misleading information that is intentionally deceptive.
- Impersonation:
  - Involves pretending to be someone else to gain trust or access.
- Business Email Compromise (BEC):
  - Sophisticated scam that compromises legitimate business email accounts to conduct unauthorized transfers of funds.
- Pretexting:
  - Attacker invents a scenario (a pretext) to persuade a victim to divulge information.
- Watering Hole Attack:
  - Attacker loads malware onto sites that the targets frequently visit.
- Brand Impersonation:
  - Involves attackers posing as trusted brands such as banks and technology companies.
- Typosquatting:
  - Involves attackers maliciously using domain names that are typo versions of legitimate domains.
