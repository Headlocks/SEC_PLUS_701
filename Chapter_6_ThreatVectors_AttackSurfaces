Message-based Communication threats
  - poses significant security risks due ot its widespread use, users' trust in platforms, and the potential for immediate damage
    examples
      -email  
      - Short Message Service (SMS)
      - Instant Messaging (IM)
      - Spam and Spam over Internet Messaging (SPIM)
    Mitigation
      - user training and awareness
      - spam filters
      - secure email gateways

Image-Based threats
  - involve using digital images to exploit vulnerabilities in software and systems
    examples
      - using images in a phishing attack
      - disguising malware as an image file
    mitigation
      - user training and awareness
      - using up-to-date antivirus/anti-malware software

file-based threats
  - leverage common file formats such as .doc and .jpg to conceal harmful scripts and execute malicious activities
    - malicious code is embedded within or attached to these files, which are distributed via email attachments, downloads from websites, and file-sharing services
  mitigation
    - user training and awareness
    - file scanning
    - strict file permissions

voice call threats
  - involve malicious activities conducted through phone calls
    - attackers aim to deceive or manipulate individuals into disclosing information by pretending to be trusted entities
    mitigation
      - user training and awareness
      - secure call authentication
      - report suspicious calls

removable device threats
  - involve using portable storage devices that transmit malware. examples are USB drives, external hard drives, and memory cards.
    - when an infected device connects to a computer, it may execute malicious code and spread malware to connected systems
  mitigation
    - user training and awareness
    - scan devices for malware
    - restrict device use

vulnerable software
  - has exploitable flaws or weaknesses in its code or design
    - two approaches help protect vulnerable software
      - client-based security
        - involves installing software agents on client devices for active monitoring and protection
      - agentless security
        - centralized; it enables monitoring and protection without installing software on individual client devices
