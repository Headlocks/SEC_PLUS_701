## Chapter 16: Various Activities Associated with Vulnerability Management

Identification methods
  - help locate, identify, and document security flaws in an organization's digital ecosystem
    - key identification methods are vulnerabilty scans and software composition analysis

Vulnerability Scan Tools
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
    - analyze source code or binaries without executing the program
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
    - test applications while running to find vulnerabilities not visible in the code
  - interacative application security testing (IAST)
    - combine SAST and DAST for comprehensive analysis
  - Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)
    - gather data from various sources to provide threat insights
  - Security Information and Event Management systems (SIEM)
    - provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications

application security
  - identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in software applications
      - static analysis (SAST)
        - examines source code or binaries without execution, enabling early identification and resolution of security flaws
      - Dynamic analysis (DAST)
        - tests applications during operation, simulating attacks to uncover vulnerabilities that static analysis might miss
      - Package monitoring
        - continuously surveilles third-party software packages and libraries for security vulnerabilities

threat feeds and databases
  - threat feeds
    - real-time repository and transmission channel for data points that indicate cyber threats
  - proprietary/third-party feed
    - specialized channel of threat feeds, typically requiring subscription
  - open-source intelligence threats (OSINT)
    - threats shared in public forums, databases, and code repositories
  - information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs)
    - repositories for organizations to share threates received and learn about others; organized by industry

Penetration testing
  - simulates real-world attacks to uncover vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications
    - planning
    - reconnaissance
    - exploitation
    - post-exploitation
    - reporting

responsible disclosure program
  - framework encouraging ethical reporting of security vulnerabilities
    - outline secure procedures for external researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities
    - incentives include monetary rewards and public recognition

bug bounty program
  - offers financial incentives for discovering and reporting software vulnerabilities
    - organizations host bug bounty programs to leverage the collective expertise of security researchers
    - incentives vary from nominal to substantial rewards
    - ethical hackers often receive public acknowledgement for their contributions, enhancing their reputation and career prospects

system/process audit
  - audit
    - comprehensive examination and assessment of an organization's processes, controls, and systems
      - may use specialized tools such as nessus or wireshark to examine ntwork traffic and configurations

analysis
  - transforms raw data about vulnerabilities and threats into comprehensive insights
    -common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS)
      - industry-standard tool for evaluating the severity and urgency of vulnerabilities; assigns scores form zero to 10
    - common vulnerability enumerations (CVE)
      - standardized system for cataloging security flaws; provides historical data about remediation
    - vulnerability classification
      - organized categorization of vulnerabilities based on nature, risk level, affected component, or potential impact
    - exposure factor (EF)
      - percentage of loss that a company would experience if a specific asset were compromised
    - environmental variables
      - specific conditions or factors within an organization's context influencing the impact and exploitability of vulnerabilities
    - industry/organizational impact
      - potential consequences of vulnerabilities beyond an organization's boundaries
    - risk tolerant
      - extent to which an organization is willing to accept exposure to threats

vulnerability response and remediation
  - the systematic process of identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in an organization's technology
    - patching
      - applying updates to software components to fix known vulnerabilities
    - segmentation
      - network segmentation divides a network into smaller segments to contain breaches and minimize damage
    - compensating controls
      - alternate measures to reduce the risk of existing or potential control weaknesses
    - insurance
      - provides financial risk transfer in case of data compromise
    - exceptions and exemptions
      - exceptions and exemptions are granted for vulnerabilities accepted due to business needs or technical constraints

validation of remediation
  - ensures that vulnerabilities have been adequately addressed
    - rescanning
      - running vulnerability scans again after apply patches or making changes
    - audit
      - involves a thorough manual review, often conducted by an independent third party or internal audit team
    - verification   
      - synthesizes insights form rescanning and auditing activities to affirm to the success or failure of remediation efforts

reporting
  - turns scanning, patching, verification, and validation into actionable insights
    - serves as organizational memory for cybersecurity efforts
    - reports vary depending on audience
      - technical teams
      - senior management
      - regulatory bodies
      - information-sharing organizations
