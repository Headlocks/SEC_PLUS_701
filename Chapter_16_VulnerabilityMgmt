## Chapter 16: Various Activities Associated with Vulnerability Management

### Identification methods
- Help locate, identify, and document security flaws in an organization's digital ecosystem
  - Key identification methods are vulnerability scans and software composition analysis

### Vulnerability Scan Tools
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
  - Analyze source code or binaries without executing the program
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
  - Test applications while running to find vulnerabilities not visible in the code
- Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
  - Combine SAST and DAST for comprehensive analysis
- Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)
  - Gather data from various sources to provide threat insights
- Security Information and Event Management systems (SIEM)
  - Provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications

### Application Security
- Identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in software applications
  - Static analysis (SAST)
    - Examines source code or binaries without execution, enabling early identification and resolution of security flaws
  - Dynamic analysis (DAST)
    - Tests applications during operation, simulating attacks to uncover vulnerabilities that static analysis might miss
  - Package monitoring
    - Continuously surveilles third-party software packages and libraries for security vulnerabilities

### Threat Feeds and Databases
- Threat feeds
  - Real-time repository and transmission channel for data points that indicate cyber threats
- Proprietary/third-party feed
  - Specialized channel of threat feeds, typically requiring subscription
- Open-source intelligence threats (OSINT)
  - Threats shared in public forums, databases, and code repositories
- Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)
  - Repositories for organizations to share threats received and learn about others; organized by industry

### Penetration Testing
- Simulates real-world attacks to uncover vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications
  - Planning
  - Reconnaissance
  - Exploitation
  - Post-exploitation
  - Reporting

### Responsible Disclosure Program
- Framework encouraging ethical reporting of security vulnerabilities
  - Outline secure procedures for external researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities
  - Incentives include monetary rewards and public recognition

### Bug Bounty Program
- Offers financial incentives for discovering and reporting software vulnerabilities
  - Organizations host bug bounty programs to leverage the collective expertise of security researchers
  - Incentives vary from nominal to substantial rewards
  - Ethical hackers often receive public acknowledgement for their contributions, enhancing their reputation and career prospects

### System/Process Audit
- Audit
  - Comprehensive examination and assessment of an organization's processes, controls, and systems
    - May use specialized tools such as Nessus or Wireshark to examine network traffic and configurations

### Analysis
- Transforms raw data about vulnerabilities and threats into comprehensive insights
  - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
    - Industry-standard tool for evaluating the severity and urgency of vulnerabilities; assigns scores from zero to 10
  - Common Vulnerability Enumerations (CVE)
    - Standardized system for cataloging security flaws; provides historical data about remediation
  - Vulnerability classification
    - Organized categorization of vulnerabilities based on nature, risk level, affected component, or potential impact
  - Exposure factor (EF)
    - Percentage of loss that a company would experience if a specific asset were compromised
  - Environmental variables
    - Specific conditions or factors within an organization's context influencing the impact and exploitability of vulnerabilities
  - Industry/organizational impact
    - Potential consequences of vulnerabilities beyond an organization's boundaries
  - Risk tolerance
    - Extent to which an organization is willing to accept exposure to threats

### Vulnerability Response and Remediation
- The systematic process of identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in an organization's technology
  - Patching
    - Applying updates to software components to fix known vulnerabilities
  - Segmentation
    - Network segmentation divides a network into smaller segments to contain breaches and minimize damage
  - Compensating controls
    - Alternate measures to reduce the risk of existing or potential control weaknesses
  - Insurance
    - Provides financial risk transfer in case of data compromise
  - Exceptions and exemptions
    - Exceptions and exemptions are granted for vulnerabilities accepted due to business needs or technical constraints

### Validation of Remediation
- Ensures that vulnerabilities have been adequately addressed
  - Rescanning
    - Running vulnerability scans again after applying patches or making changes
  - Audit
    - Involves a thorough manual review, often conducted by an independent third party or internal audit team
  - Verification
    - Synthesizes insights from rescanning and auditing activities to affirm the success or failure of remediation efforts

### Reporting
- Turns scanning, patching, verification, and validation into actionable insights
  - Serves as organizational memory for cybersecurity efforts
  - Reports vary depending on audience
    - Technical teams
    - Senior management
    - Regulatory bodies
    - Information-sharing organizations
