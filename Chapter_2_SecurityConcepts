# Chapter 2: Security Concepts

## Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA)
- **Confidentiality**
  - Safeguards information from unauthorized access and disclosure
- **Integrity**
  - Ensures data remains accurate and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle
- **Availability**
  - Ensures systems and data are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users

## Non-Repudiation
- Ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or a sent message
- Provides proof of the origin and integrity of data
- Digital signatures are commonly used to provide non-repudiation in digital communications or storage

## Authentication, Authorization, Accounting (AAA)
- **Authentication**
  - Ensures the validity of someone's identity and prevents unauthorized access
- **Authorization**
  - Determines what actions users are allowed to perform after they have been authenticated
- **Accounting**
  - Involves tracking and recording users' activities and resource usage

## Gap Analysis
- A strategic planning tool used to evaluate differences between the current state and an ideal or desired state
- Helps pinpoint deficiencies in cybersecurity measures, whether in technology, software, personnel training, or policy enforcement
- Enables organizations to address and close these gaps effectively

## Zero Trust
- A network security concept centered on not trusting any entity or device by default
- Grants access based on verified factors rather than inherent trust
- Establishes trust through mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, and validation of security posture

### Control Plane
- Adaptive identity
- Threat scope reduction
- Policy-driven access control
- Secured zones
- Policy engine
- Policy administrator

### Data Plane
- Subject/system
- Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)
- Implicit trust zones

## Physical Security
- Badges
- Fencing
- Video surveillance
- Security guards
- Sensors
- Lighting
- Barricades

## Deception and Disruption Technology
- **Deception**
  - Involves the use of decoys, traps, and other deceptive measures to mislead and thwart attackers
- **Disruption**
  - Involves techniques and tools that disrupt or impair attackers' ability to execute their malicious activities
  - Honeyfiles, honeypots, honeynets, honeytokens

### Honeyfiles
- Serve as decoys within a network
- Security teams can study the attackers' behavior without disturbing normal organizational operations

### Honeypot
- A decoy system or network segment designed to attract and trap potential attackers
- Mimics legitimate systems or services to lure attackers into interacting with it, allowing security teams to monitor and analyze their behavior

### Honeynets
- A network of interconnected honeypots and other decoy systems designed to deceive and trap potential attackers
- Provides a comprehensive view of attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by simulating a full-scale network segment

### Honeytokens
- Pieces of fake or fabricated data placed within a system or network to detect unauthorized access or activity
- Serve as indicators of compromise, alerting security teams to potential breaches or suspicious behavior
- Designed to appear as legitimate or valuable data to attackers, which entices attackers to interact with or access them
