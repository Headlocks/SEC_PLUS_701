CIA Triad
  - Confidentiality
    - Safeguards information from unauthorized access and disclosure
  - Integrity
    - Ensures data remains accurate and trustworthy throughout its lifecycle
  - Availability
    - Ensures systems and data are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users

Non-Repudiation (ensures that someone cannot deny the validity of something, such as the authorship of a statement)
  - A legal concept widely used in information security to provide proof of the origin and integrity of data
  - Digital signatures are commonly used to provide non-repudiation in digital communications or storage

AAA
  - Authentication
    - Ensures the validity of someone's identity and prevents unauthorized access
  - Authorization
    - Determines what actions users are allowed to perform after they have been authenticated
  - Accounting
    - Involves tracking and recording users' activities and resource use

Gap Analysis (a strategic planning tool used to evaluate differences between the current state and an ideal or desired state)
  - Helps pinpoint deficiencies in cybersecurity measures, whether in technology, software, personnel training, or policy enforcement
  - Enables organizations to address and close these gaps effectively

Zero Trust (network security concept centered on not trusting any entity or device by default)
  - Allows access based on various known factors rather than relying on inherent trust
  - Establishes trust through mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, and validation of security posture
  - Control Plane
    - Adaptive identity
    - Threat scope reduction  
    - Policy-driven access control
    - Secured zones
    - Policy engine
    - Policy administrator
  - Data Plane
    - Subject/system
    - Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)
    - Implicit trust zones

Physical Security
  - Badges
  - Fencing
  - Video surveillance
  - Security guards
  - Sensors
  - Lighting
  - Barricades

Deception and Disruption Technology
  - Deception (involves the use of decoys, traps, and other deceptive measures to mislead and thwart attackers)
  - Disruption (involves techniques and tools that disrupt or impair attackers' ability to execute their malicious activities)
    - Honeyfiles, honeypots, honeynets, honeytokens

Honeyfiles (files created to serve as bait for potential attackers, designed to lure them into interaction)
  - Serve as decoys within a network
  - Security teams can study the attackers' behavior without disturbing normal organizational operations

Honeypot (a decoy system or network segment designed to attract and trap potential attackers)
  - Mimics legitimate systems or services to lure attackers into interacting with it, allowing security teams to monitor and analyze their behavior

Honeynets (a network of interconnected honeypots and other decoy systems designed to deceive and trap potential attackers)
  - Provides a comprehensive view of attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by simulating a full-scale network segment

Honeytokens (pieces of fake or fabricated data placed within a system or network to detect unauthorized access or activity)
  - Serve as indicators of compromise, alerting security teams to potential breaches or suspicious behavior
  - Designed to appear as legitimate or valuable data to attackers, which entices attackers to interact with or access them
