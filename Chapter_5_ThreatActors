## Chapter 5: Threat Actors

# Threat Actors
  - Understanding the characteristics and traits of different types of attackers is crucial for effective cybersecurity defense. Threat actors vary widely in their expertise and resources. They range from inexperienced individuals to highly skilled syndicates and agents of nation-states. Threat actors have diverse motivations such as financial gain, intellectual property theft, and causing disruption/chaos.

## Types of Threat Actors

### Unskilled Attackers
- Also known as script kiddies, lack technical skills and often rely on readily available malicious code copied from the internet.

### Hacktivists
- Combine hacking skills with activist motives, targeting organizations or systems to promote social or political agendas.

### Cybercriminals
- Operating either independently or in syndicates, are motivated mainly by financial gain. They may use considerable resources and sophistication in their attacks.

### Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
- Highly sophisticated and well-funded attackers with extensive resources and extremely high motivation. They're often associated with nation-states.

### Insider Threats
- Individuals within organizations who exploit their authorized access for malicious purposes.

### Shadow IT
- Involves employees using an organization's IT systems and services without the IT department's knowledge.

## Attributes of Actors

### Hacktivists
- Typically motivated by social or political issues.
