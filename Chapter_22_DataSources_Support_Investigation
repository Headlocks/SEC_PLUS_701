## Chapter 22: Using Data Sources to Support an Investigation

Log Data
  - systematically recorded information that's generated by hardware, software, and operating systems
    - captures events, transactions, and other activities within a system or network
    - serves as a chronological record for troubleshooting, security monitoring, and investigations
    - required by various regulations (HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX)
  Syslog
    - is a commonly used protocol for centralizing log data

Firewall Logs
  - help IT monitor the traffic allowed and denied by a firewall
    - reveal typical traffic patterns and unauthorized access attempts
    - common elements
      - timestamp
      - Action (ALLOW or DENY)
      - Protocol (TCP)
      - Source IP
      - Destination IP
      - Source Port
      - Destination Port
      - Example
        - 2023-09-23 14:32:10 ALLOW TCP 192.168.1.2 8.8.8.8 443 80

Application Logs
  - are records of services, events, and systems within an application
    - provide (nearly) end-to-end visibility of activity
    - it's important to parse, partition, and analyze all logs related to security incidents
    - critical process data logged about the user, application, and system can help responders understand the nature and extend of an attack

Endpoint Logs
  - give detailed information about activities on individual devices connected to a network
    - help identify suspicious or unauthorized behaviors
      - installation of unauthorized software
      - attempts to acecss restricted files
      - unrecognized application executions
      - examples
        - 2023-09-23 14:35:00 User "JohnDoe" initiated "New_Outbound_Connection" to IP "203.0.113.42" on Port "8080"
        - 2023-09-23 14:36:00 User "JohnDoe" executed "Unknown_Application.exe"

OS-Specific Security Logs
  - provide information about events and activities on a specific system
    - system processes, driver loading data, errors, warnings, and failures
    - in windows, logs can be obtained via the Event Viewer and Windows Admin Center
    - On Linux hosts, log files are typically found in the **/var/log** directory
    - Collect system logs regularly and store them in a secure and separate location

Intrustion Preventsion System (IPS) / Intrustion Detection System (IDS) Logs
  -an IPS and IDS work together to prevent and detect potentially harmful activities within a network. Their logs can alert you to various attacks such as SQL injections and cross-site scripting
    - generated by solutions like Snort and Suricata
    - examples
      - 2023-09-23 13:45:32 ALERT SQL injection detected from 192.168.1.4
      - 2023-09-23 13:46:10 ALERT Brute-force attempt from 203.0.113.7

Network Logs
  - capture data traffic across the network infrastructure
    - generated by network monitoring tools like wireshark and SolarWinds
    - provide insights into bandwidth usage, connection times, and protocol types
    - examples
      - 2023-09-23 14:20:15 INFO TCP Connection from 192.168.1.2 to 8.8.8.4.4
      - 2023-09-23 14:21:00 WARNING Large data transfer to 203.0.113.8

Metadata
  - is information about data, such as activities performed on personal computers or mobile phones
    - while individual metadata may seem irrelevant, it becomes valuable when combined with other data
    - categories of metadata
      - descriptive
      - structural
      - preservation
      - use
      - provenance
      - administrative

Data sources
  - data sources in IT are the tools and methods utilized to gather, analyze, and present information for investigations
    - sources range from vulnerability scans to dashboards with real-time analytics
    - understanding data sources is critical for a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity

vulnerability scans
  - systematicaly examine networks, systems, or applications to identify and assess security weaknesses
    - specialized software probes for known vulnerabilities
    - network scans should include all devices with IP addresses and their software
    - save results for 24 months+

automated reports
  - synthesize various security metrics and events
    - follow regular schedules (daily scanning) and can also be triggered by specific events
    - generated by Security information and Event Management (SIEM) systems like Splunk and IBM QRadar
    - offer insight into potential security threats and anomalies

dashboards
  - is a user interface that organizes information for easier understanding and real-time monitoring of network performance and security
    - typically uses graphs, charts, and gauges
    - serves as a centralized display, consolidating data from multiple sources

packet captures
  - give a detailed view of network activity
    - analysts use packet captures to:
      - identify suspicious patterns
      - detect deviations from normal network behavior
    - wireshark is commonly used to capture and analyze packets
