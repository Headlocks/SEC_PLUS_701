## Chapter 14: Security Techniques to Computing Resources

### Secure Baselines
- Standardized sets of minimum configuration and security controls for systems and software
  - Asset tagging
    - Assigning unique identifiers to each asset for easier tracking
  - Version control
    - Documenting all software versions used by the organization; helps identify outdated or unsupported versions that may pose security risks
  - Schedule scans
    - Scheduling regular vulnerability scans to identify any new weaknesses
  - Manual review
    - Human reviews data, logs, and systems to help prioritize vulnerabilities based on actual organizational risk. Human judgment and intuition can identify issues that automated tools miss.
  - Disable unnecessary services
    - Turn off services and features not required for the system's primary function
  - User access control
    - Limit user permissions to what is necessary for their roles
  - Change log
    - Maintain a record of any changes made to the baseline, who made them, and why
  - Audit trail
    - Ensure that documentation is in a format that can be easily audited for compliance purposes
  - Validation testing
    - Confirm that the baseline settings do not disrupt necessary functions
  - Rollback plan
    - Have a plan to reverse changes in the event of unforeseen issues during deployment
  - Patch management
    - Regularly update software and systems to patch known vulnerabilities
  - Review and update
    - Periodically review the secure baseline to ensure that it aligns with current best practices in cybersecurity

### Hardening Targets
- The process of strengthening the security defenses of computing resources to resist attack
  - Common hardening techniques
    - Firmware updates
    - Network segmentation
    - VLANs
    - Air-gapping
    - Disabling unnecessary features
    - Real-time monitoring
    - Data encryption
    - Changing default passwords
    - Ensuring network-level security

### Wireless Devices
- Operate without physical wired connections. They use methods such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networks to communicate
  - Site survey
    - Assess the current wireless environment and plan for Wi-Fi network optimization
  - Heat maps
    - Visualize wireless activity to determine optimal access point placement for coverage and performance

### Mobile Solutions
- Mobile device management (MDM) is crucial for successful implementation of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies
  - BYOD policies raise legal concerns regarding data ownership, privacy rights, and employee misconduct
  - Ensure clear separation of organizational and personal information
  - Encryption, regular software updates, and password complexity are essential for mitigating mobile device security risks
    - Bring your own device (BYOD)
    - Corporate owned personally enabled (COPE)
    - Choose your own device (CYOD)
    - Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)

### Connection Methods
- Bluetooth
  - Susceptible to attacks like bluejacking and bluesnarfing
  - bluejacking
    - unsolicitied bluetooth
  - bluesnarfing
    - steal information 
  - bluebugging
    - turn on device microphone
  - blueborne
    - flood device with connection requests causing crashes
- Wi-Fi
  - Vulnerable to various exploits, e.g., firmware flaws that lead to buffer overflow
- Cellular Connections
  - Including 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G, all raise security concerns. Using newer devices is generally best
- GPS and Geolocation Technologies
  - Raise privacy and security concerns
- Satellite Communications (SATCOM)
  - Require firmware updates to address vulnerabilities and prevent exploits
- Infrared connections and wireless USB receivers
  - Often overlooked in security reviews

### Wireless Security Settings
- WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3)
  - Uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) to replace the vulnerable preshared key (PSK) system
- RADIUS Federation (Remote Authentication Dial-in Service)
  - Enables secure communication among multiple RADIUS servers
- TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Acess-Control System)
  - used by administartion and it for secure connections
- Cryptographic Protocols
  - WPA3-Personal and WPA3-Enterprise offer robust encryption methods like AES-CCMP and HMAC-SHA for data protection
- Authentication Protocols
  - LDAP, Kerberos, and 802.1X are authentication methods tailored to various environments

### Application Security
- Refers to the security measures implemented at the application level
  - Input validation
    - Ensures data integrity by verifying the type and content of user or application input, preventing vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLi
  - Secure cookies
    - Implement the secure attribute in HTTP response cookies to prevent unauthorized access and transmission of sensitive information
  - Static code analysis
    - Uses Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to scan source code for vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle
      - Provides real-time feedback to developers
      - Enables prompt issue resolution
  - Code signing
    - Digitally signs executables and scripts to verify authenticity and integrity
      - Ensures software has not been altered or corrupted
      - Prevents malicious tampering during transmission

### Sandboxing
- Creates a confined execution environment for running untrusted or suspicious code safely
  - Adds an additional layer of security
  - Reduces the risk of malware infection via email attachments while maintaining workflow efficiency for employees

### Monitoring
- Is crucial for proactive cybersecurity, providing continuous surveillance of systems, networks, and applications
  - Involves detecting, logging, and responding to specific activities or conditions to identify current issues and anticipate future vulnerabilities
  - Can flag unusual account activities such as sudden large withdrawals, frequent international transactions, or simultaneous logins from multiple locations
