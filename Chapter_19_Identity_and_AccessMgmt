## Chapter 19: Implementing and Maintaining Identity and Access Management

Provisioning/De-provisioning User Accounts
  - Provisioning
    - setting up a user account with necessary permissions and access settings
  - De-provisioning
    - disabling or removing permissions and settings from a user account
  - well-managed provisioning and de-provisioning are crucial for ensuring users always have appropriate access

Permission Assignments and Implications
  - permission assignment
    - granting specific levels of access or activities (read, edit, delete) to users, groups, or system processes
  - type of permissions assignments
    - user-level
    - group-level
    - role-based
    - resource-based

identity proofing
  - is the process of verifying a user's or system's identity within an organization
    - invovles multiple levels of authentication ranging from passwords to biometric data
    - extends beyond initial authenticaiton; includes periodic re-authentication or session time-outs

federation
  - one system authenticates users and sends their authentication information to other systems

Single Sign-On (SSO)
  - enables one set of credentials for access to multiple services or applications
    - minimizes the number of times a user needs to authenticate after initial login
  - SSO protocols
    - LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
    - OAuth (Open Authorization)
    - SAML (Security Assertion Markup Langauge)

Interoperabiility
  - is the ability of different systems to work together. its crucial for identity and access management (IAM) systems
    - IAM systems need to integrate seamlessly with various databases, applications, and authentication protocols. Lack of integration interfereds with needs for access and auditing
    - collaboration with external partners requires secure cross-boundary authentication and authorization
  - Interopable IAM Systems
    - can adop to new technologies and compliance requirements without overhauling existing infrastructure

Attestation
  - provides evidence or proof, allowing one program or system to authenticate itself to another
  - remote attestation
    - enables a system to make reliable statements about the software its running to another system, which can make authorization decisions based on that information
  - TPM (Trusted Platform Model) quote operation
    - verifies the contents of a TPM chip's platform configurations registers (PCRs) during provisioning
  - Methods of attestation may be vulnerable to replay attacks, masquerading, and other cyberthreats

Access Controls
  - organize and manage admission to physical areas and computer systems
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
    - is controlled by the fire system, not the resource owner. when users are assigned a role, they get access to its resources
  - Rule-based access control
    - is also known as lebel-based access control. Example of a rule governing access: During certain hours each day, access is only permitted to specific IP addresses
  - Mandatory access control (MAC) 
    - is the strictist control. its set by the system and uses security classifications for data
  - Discretionary access control (DAC)
    - generally determined by the owner
  - attribute-based access control (ABAC)
    - is dynamic and uses context. it can combine various user, group, and resource attributes to determine whether access should be granted
  - least privilege
    - means the user only has the access required for their job

Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
  - is the process of authenticating a user by validating two or more claims from different categories of factors
    - two-factor authentication (2FA)
      - a subset of MFA in which two factors are required to authenticate
    - factor categories
      - something you know
      - something you have
      - something you are
    - biometrics (distinctive body measurements) and security keys (hardware devices) may be part of MFA

Password Concepts
  - guidelines and practices for ensuring strong, secure passwords
    - passwords serve as the primary barrier to protect sensitive information and access controls
    - issues to consider when setting password requirements
      - password length
      - password complexity
      - password reuse
      - password expiration
      - password age

Privileged Access Management (PAM) tools
  - centrally manage access to privileged accounts based on the principle of least privilege
    - just-in-time (JIT) permissions
      - give access for a limited time
    - ephemeral
      - credentials are generated for specific sessions or tasks and invalidated shortly after completion. they expire more quickly than JIT permissions
    - password vaulting
      - means using a centralized, encrypted repository to store various access credentials
