## Chapter 19: Implementing and Maintaining Identity and Access Management

### Provisioning/De-provisioning User Accounts
- **Provisioning**
  - Setting up a user account with necessary permissions and access settings
- **De-provisioning**
  - Disabling or removing permissions and settings from a user account
- Well-managed provisioning and de-provisioning are crucial for ensuring users always have appropriate access

### Permission Assignments and Implications
- **Permission Assignment**
  - Granting specific levels of access or activities (read, edit, delete) to users, groups, or system processes
- **Types of Permission Assignments**
  - User-level
  - Group-level
  - Role-based
  - Resource-based

### Identity Proofing
- The process of verifying a user's or system's identity within an organization
  - Involves multiple levels of authentication ranging from passwords to biometric data
  - Extends beyond initial authentication; includes periodic re-authentication or session time-outs

### Federation
- One system authenticates users and sends their authentication information to other systems

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Enables one set of credentials for access to multiple services or applications
  - Minimizes the number of times a user needs to authenticate after initial login
- **SSO Protocols**
  - LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
  - OAuth (Open Authorization)
  - SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)

### Interoperability
- The ability of different systems to work together, crucial for identity and access management (IAM) systems
  - IAM systems need to integrate seamlessly with various databases, applications, and authentication protocols. Lack of integration interferes with access and auditing needs
  - Collaboration with external partners requires secure cross-boundary authentication and authorization
- **Interoperable IAM Systems**
  - Can adapt to new technologies and compliance requirements without overhauling existing infrastructure

### Attestation
- Provides evidence or proof, allowing one program or system to authenticate itself to another
- **Remote Attestation**
  - Enables a system to make reliable statements about the software it's running to another system, which can make authorization decisions based on that information
- **TPM (Trusted Platform Module) Quote Operation**
  - Verifies the contents of a TPM chip's platform configurations registers (PCRs) during provisioning
- Methods of attestation may be vulnerable to replay attacks, masquerading, and other cyber threats

### Access Controls
- Organize and manage admission to physical areas and computer systems
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Controlled by the fire system, not the resource owner. When users are assigned a role, they get access to its resources
- **Rule-Based Access Control**
  - Also known as label-based access control. Example of a rule governing access: During certain hours each day, access is only permitted to specific IP addresses
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**
  - The strictest control. It's set by the system and uses security classifications for data
- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**
  - Generally determined by the owner
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
  - Dynamic and uses context. It can combine various user, group, and resource attributes to determine whether access should be granted
- **Least Privilege**
  - Means the user only has the access required for their job

### Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
- The process of authenticating a user by validating two or more claims from different categories of factors
  - **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
    - A subset of MFA in which two factors are required to authenticate
  - **Factor Categories**
    - Something you know
    - Something you have
    - Something you are
  - Biometrics (distinctive body measurements) and security keys (hardware devices) may be part of MFA

### Password Concepts
- Guidelines and practices for ensuring strong, secure passwords
  - Passwords serve as the primary barrier to protect sensitive information and access controls
  - Issues to consider when setting password requirements
    - Password length
    - Password complexity
    - Password reuse
    - Password expiration
    - Password age

### Privileged Access Management (PAM) Tools
- Centrally manage access to privileged accounts based on the principle of least privilege
  - **Just-In-Time (JIT) Permissions**
    - Give access for a limited time
  - **Ephemeral**
    - Credentials are generated for specific sessions or tasks and invalidated shortly after completion. They expire more quickly than JIT permissions
  - **Password Vaulting**
    - Using a centralized, encrypted repository to store various access credentials
