Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

  - PKI encompasses key management, certificate authorities (CA), intermediate CAs, and registration authorities (RAs)
  - PKI enables secure connections for websites, email transmissions, and remote access by utilizing asymmetric key pairs consisting of public and private keys
  - Private keys are kept secret, while public keys can be distributed. private key escrow may be provided by trusted third parties
  - Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Onlince Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) check if a cert is revoked

Encryption
  - Converts information into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access
  - different levels of encryption offer varying degrees of protection
    - full-disk encryption secures an entire hard drive, including data, files, and the operating systems
    - partition encryption involves treating portions of a disk as separate units
    - file encryption, or encrypting individual files, adds an additional layer of security

Transport/Communication
  - Data security and encryption is essential, whether the data is at rest, in transit, or in use.

Cryptographic Algorithm

  Hashing
     - strictly for integrity checking

  symmetric and assymetric cryptgoraphy
    - for confidentiality

  symmetric
    - 1 key same key
    - good for speed, and large data
    - uses a single key for both encryption and decryption

  assymetric
    - 2 keys different keys
    - slower process, but with far better security
    - PKI's
    - employs a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decyrption

  Public Keys
    - anybody can access it, designed for public

  Private Keys
    - for the recipient only

  Recovery Keys
    - a duplication of a private key
    - stored in "Key Escrow"
    - need a recovery agent in order to access the "Key Escrow"

Key Exchange
  - also known as a key establishment, is a cryptographic process that enables two parties to exchange cryptographic keys
  - Internet Key Exchange (IKE)

Algorithms, Key Length, Tools

  Algorithms
    - mathematical formulas used in cryptographic processes
  Key Length:
    - the number of bits in an encryption algorithm's key; longer keys typically provide stronger encryption
  tools:
    - specialized technologies and protocols for securing and managing digital information throughout its lifecycle

Key Management System (KMS)
  - safeguards digital data by managing codes used to lock and unlock data
    -main functions
      - generates cryptographic keys
      - stores keys securely
      - exchange keys
      - key use and access control
      - key replacement and rotation

Top 4 Key Exchange Algorithms

  RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

    - Based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.
    - Widely used for secure key exchange and digital signatures.
    - Vulnerable to certain attacks if not properly implemented (e.g., small key sizes).

  Diffie-Hellman (DH)

    - Allows two parties to securely share a secret key over a public channel.
    - Based on the discrete logarithm problem.
    - Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if authentication is not used.

  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)

    - A variant of Diffie-Hellman using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).
    - Provides higher security with smaller key sizes compared to traditional DH.
    - More efficient and faster than RSA and DH in terms of computation.

  Post-Quantum Key Exchange Algorithms (e.g., NTRU, Kyber)

    - Designed to be resistant to attacks by quantum computers.
    - Based on lattice-based cryptography and other quantum-safe methods.
    - Currently being standardized by NIST for post-quantum security.

Trusted Platform Module and Hardware Security Module
  Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
    - a hardwrae based security technology using a secure cryptoprocessor chip to execute cryptographic operations, generate and manage cryptographic keys, authenticate platform devices, and ensure platform integrity by storing security measurements

  Hardware Security Module (HSM)
    - a physical device serving as a secure cryptoprocessor, providing faster encryption than software-based solutions, and generally tamper-proof
    - similar to a military "KG"

Rainbow tables
  - Rainbow tables are precomputed tables that map hashed values to their corresponding plaintext inputs, allowing for faster reverse-engineering of hashed passwords.

Secure Enclave
  - is a hardware-based feature found in devices like iPhones
    - segregates encryption tasks and runs on a separate microprocessor with its own operating system
    - designed to resist tampering, it prevents access to its data through strict protocols
    - the enclave is resistant ot software and hardware attacks
