Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

  - PKI encompasses key management, certificate authorities (CA), intermediate CAs, and registration authorities (RAs)
  - PKI enables secure connections for websites, email transmissions, and remote access by utilizing asymmetric key pairs consisting of public and private keys
  - Private keys are kept secret, while public keys can be distributed. private key escrow may be provided by trusted third parties
  - Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Onlince Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) check if a cert is revoked

Encryption
  - Converts information into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access. (Confidentiality purposes)
  - different levels of encryption offer varying degrees of protection
    - full-disk encryption secures an entire hard drive, including data, files, and the operating systems
    - partition encryption involves treating portions of a disk as separate units
    - file encryption, or encrypting individual files, adds an additional layer of security

Transport/Communication
  - Data security and encryption is essential, whether the data is at rest, in transit, or in use.

Cryptographic Algorithm

  Hashing
     - strictly for integrity checking
      - Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) splits into 1 and 2 family
      - Message Digest (MD)

  symmetric and assymetric cryptgoraphy
    - for confidentiality

  symmetric
    - 1 key same key
    - good for speed, and large data
    - uses a single key for both encryption and decryption

  assymetric
    - 2 keys different keys
    - slower process, but with far better security
    - PKI's
    - employs a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decyrption

  Public Keys
    - anybody can access it, designed for public

  Private Keys
    - for the recipient only

  Recovery Keys
    - a duplication of a private key
    - stored in "Key Escrow"
    - need a recovery agent in order to access the "Key Escrow"

Key Exchange
  - also known as a key establishment, is a cryptographic process that enables two parties to exchange cryptographic keys
  - Internet Key Exchange (IKE)

Algorithms, Key Length, Tools

  Algorithms
    - mathematical formulas used in cryptographic processes
  Key Length:
    - the number of bits in an encryption algorithm's key; longer keys typically provide stronger encryption
  tools:
    - specialized technologies and protocols for securing and managing digital information throughout its lifecycle

Key Management System (KMS)
  - safeguards digital data by managing codes used to lock and unlock data
    -main functions
      - generates cryptographic keys
      - stores keys securely
      - exchange keys
      - key use and access control
      - key replacement and rotation

Top 4 Key Exchange Algorithms

  RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

    - Based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.
    - Widely used for secure key exchange and digital signatures.
    - Vulnerable to certain attacks if not properly implemented (e.g., small key sizes).

  Diffie-Hellman (DH)

    - Allows two parties to securely share a secret key over a public channel.
    - Based on the discrete logarithm problem.
    - Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if authentication is not used.

  Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)

    - A variant of Diffie-Hellman using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).
    - Provides higher security with smaller key sizes compared to traditional DH.
    - More efficient and faster than RSA and DH in terms of computation.

  Post-Quantum Key Exchange Algorithms (e.g., NTRU, Kyber)

    - Designed to be resistant to attacks by quantum computers.
    - Based on lattice-based cryptography and other quantum-safe methods.
    - Currently being standardized by NIST for post-quantum security.

Trusted Platform Module and Hardware Security Module
  Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
    - a hardwrae based security technology using a secure cryptoprocessor chip to execute cryptographic operations, generate and manage cryptographic keys, authenticate platform devices, and ensure platform integrity by storing security measurements

  Hardware Security Module (HSM)
    - a physical device serving as a secure cryptoprocessor, providing faster encryption than software-based solutions, and generally tamper-proof
    - similar to a military "KG"

Rainbow tables
  - Rainbow tables are precomputed tables that map hashed values to their corresponding plaintext inputs, allowing for faster reverse-engineering of hashed passwords.

Secure Enclave
  - is a hardware-based feature found in devices like iPhones
    - segregates encryption tasks and runs on a separate microprocessor with its own operating system
    - designed to resist tampering, it prevents access to its data through strict protocols
    - the enclave is resistant ot software and hardware attacks

Obfuscation & Steganography

  obfuscation
    - a technique used to protect sensitive information by altering or disguising the original data to prevent easy comprehension or access by unauthorized users

  steganography
    - the practice of concealing secret messages within seemingly innocuous carriers
      - audio steg
      - video steg    
      - image steg

Hashing & Salting
  Hashing
    - a one-way function that maps data to a fixed-length value, primarily for authentication and ensuring data integrity by verifying that it hasnt been altered
  salting
    - adding random data to password before hashing to enhance security

Digital Signatures
  - a mathematical scheme used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document
    - three algorithms used in a digital signature
      - key generation algorithm
      - signing algorithm
      - signature verifying algorithm
    - two properties required for a digital signature
      - authenticity verification
      - private key

key stretching
  - cryptographic technique used to enhance the security of weak keys against brute-force attacks
  salt
    - randomly generated data added to a password before hashing to prevent the same password from producing the same hash value
  pepper  
    - another randomly generated value added to a password hash, kept secret and separate from the hashed password

Blockchain & Open Public Ledger
  blockchain
    - a secure and immutable digital ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computer systems in a decentralized manner
      - prevents alteration or fraud
  open public ledger
    - a component of blockchain technology that organizes transaction information into block that are chained together chronologically
      - verifies transaction authenticity
      - prevents double spending without the need for a cental authority

Certificates
  certificate
    - a digital document issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) to verify the identity of the certificate holder and ensure the legitimacy of online communications
  certificate authorites (CA)
    - entities, typically, servers, responsible for issuing certificates to users in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system, serving as trusted third parties to validate identities and secure digital exchanges

Block Cipher
  - Take data and split it into equal blocks. each block can be encrypted individually or together. a buffer will be added if more data is needed at the end of a block.

Modes of Operation
  Counter Mode (CTR or CTM)
    - turns a block cipher into a stream cipher
Message Authentication Code (MAC)
  - verify sender and reciever traffic
Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)
  - integrity checking is conducting within the algorithm
