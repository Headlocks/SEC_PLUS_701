## Chapter 4: Cryptographic Solutions

## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

- PKI encompasses key management, certificate authorities (CAs), intermediate CAs, and registration authorities (RAs).
- PKI enables secure connections for websites, email transmissions, and remote access by utilizing asymmetric key pairs consisting of public and private keys.
- Private keys are kept secret, while public keys can be distributed. Private key escrow may be provided by trusted third parties.
- Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) check if a certificate is revoked.

## Encryption

- Converts information into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access (Confidentiality purposes).
- Different levels of encryption offer varying degrees of protection:
  - Full-disk encryption secures an entire hard drive, including data, files, and the operating systems.
  - Partition encryption involves treating portions of a disk as separate units.
  - File encryption, or encrypting individual files, adds an additional layer of security.

## Transport/Communication

- Data security and encryption are essential, whether the data is at rest, in transit, or in use.

## Cryptographic Algorithm

### Hashing

- Strictly for integrity checking.
  - Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA) splits into 1 and 2 family.
  - Message Digest (MD).

### Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography

- Used for confidentiality.

#### Symmetric

- Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
- Good for speed and large data.

#### Asymmetric

- Employs a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
- Slower process, but with far better security.
- Used in PKI.

### Public Keys

- Anybody can access it, designed for public use.

### Private Keys

- For the recipient only.

### Recovery Keys

- A duplication of a private key.
- Stored in "Key Escrow".
- Requires a recovery agent to access the "Key Escrow".

## Key Exchange

- Also known as key establishment, is a cryptographic process that enables two parties to exchange cryptographic keys.
- Internet Key Exchange (IKE).

## Algorithms, Key Length, Tools

### Algorithms

- Mathematical formulas used in cryptographic processes.

### Key Length

- The number of bits in an encryption algorithm's key; longer keys typically provide stronger encryption.

### Tools

- Specialized technologies and protocols for securing and managing digital information throughout its lifecycle.

## Key Management System (KMS)

- Safeguards digital data by managing codes used to lock and unlock data.

### Main Functions

- Generates cryptographic keys.
- Stores keys securely.
- Exchanges keys.
- Key use and access control.
- Key replacement and rotation.

## Top 4 Key Exchange Algorithms

1. **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)**

   - Based on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.
   - Widely used for secure key exchange and digital signatures.
   - Vulnerable to certain attacks if not properly implemented (e.g., small key sizes).

2. **Diffie-Hellman (DH)**

   - Allows two parties to securely share a secret key over a public channel.
   - Based on the discrete logarithm problem.
   - Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if authentication is not used.

3. **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)**

   - A variant of Diffie-Hellman using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).
   - Provides higher security with smaller key sizes compared to traditional DH.
   - More efficient and faster than RSA and DH in terms of computation.

4. **Post-Quantum Key Exchange Algorithms** (e.g., NTRU, Kyber)

   - Designed to be resistant to attacks by quantum computers.
   - Based on lattice-based cryptography and other quantum-safe methods.
   - Currently being standardized by NIST for post-quantum security.

## Trusted Platform Module and Hardware Security Module

### Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

- A hardware-based security technology using a secure cryptoprocessor chip to execute cryptographic operations, generate and manage cryptographic keys, authenticate platform devices, and ensure platform integrity.

### Hardware Security Module (HSM)

- A physical device serving as a secure cryptoprocessor, providing faster encryption than software-based solutions, and generally tamper-proof.

## Rainbow Tables

- Precomputed tables that map hashed values to their corresponding plaintext inputs, allowing for faster reverse-engineering of hashed passwords.

## Secure Enclave

- A hardware-based feature found in devices like iPhones.
- Segregates encryption tasks and runs on a separate microprocessor with its own operating system.
- Designed to resist tampering, it prevents access to its data through strict protocols.
- The enclave is resistant to software and hardware attacks.

## Obfuscation & Steganography

### Obfuscation

- A technique used to protect sensitive information by altering or disguising the original data to prevent easy comprehension or access by unauthorized users.

### Steganography

- The practice of concealing secret messages within seemingly innocuous carriers:
  - Audio steganography.
  - Video steganography.
  - Image steganography.

## Hashing & Salting

### Hashing

- A one-way function that maps data to a fixed-length value, primarily for authentication and ensuring data integrity by verifying that it hasn't been altered.

### Salting

- Adding random data to a password before hashing to enhance security.

## Digital Signatures

- A mathematical scheme used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a digital message or document.

### Three Algorithms Used in a Digital Signature

1. Key generation algorithm.
2. Signing algorithm.
3. Signature verifying algorithm.

### Two Properties Required for a Digital Signature

1. Authenticity verification.
2. Private key.

## Key Stretching

- A cryptographic technique used to enhance the security of weak keys against brute-force attacks.
  - PBKDF1/PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 1 and 2) are key derivation functions with a sliding computational cost, used to reduce vulnerability to brute-force attacks.

### Salt

- Randomly generated data added to a password before hashing to prevent the same password from producing the same hash value.

### Pepper

- Another randomly generated value added to a password hash, kept secret and separate from the hashed password.

## Blockchain & Open Public Ledger

### Blockchain

- A secure and immutable digital ledger technology that records transactions across a network of computer systems in a decentralized manner.
- Prevents alteration or fraud.

### Open Public Ledger

- A component of blockchain technology that organizes transaction information into blocks that are chained together chronologically.
- Verifies transaction authenticity.
- Prevents double spending without the need for a central authority.

## Certificates

### Certificate

- A digital document issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) to verify the identity of the certificate holder and ensure the legitimacy of online communications.
- Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) is the most generated certificate

### Certificate Authorities (CA)

- Entities, typically servers, responsible for issuing certificates to users in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system, serving as trusted third parties to validate identities and secure digital communications.
- root is the main certificate authority. 
- Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is how you reach out to a Registration Authority (RA).

## Block Cipher

- Takes data and splits it into equal blocks. Each block can be encrypted individually or together. A buffer will be added if more data is needed at the end of a block.

## Modes of Operation

### Counter Mode (CTR or CTM)

- Turns a block cipher into a stream cipher.

### Message Authentication Code (MAC)

- Verifies sender and receiver traffic.

### Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)

- Integrity checking is conducted within the algorithm.

### CCMP - CTR (Counter Mode) CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) MAC (Message Authentication Code) Protocol

- Ensures all the bits are chained together.

## Randomization

- Salt.
- IV (Initialization Vector).
- NONCE.
