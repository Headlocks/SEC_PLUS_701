Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

  - PKI encompasses key management, certificate authorities (CA), intermediate CAs, and registration authorities (RAs)
  - PKI enables secure connections for websites, email transmissions, and remote access by utilizing asymmetric key pairs consisting of public and private keys
  - Private keys are kept secret, while public keys can be distributed. private key escrow may be provided by trusted third parties
  - Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Onlince Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) check if a cert is revoked

Cryptographic Algorithm

  Hashing
     - strictly for integrity checking

  symmetric and assymetric cryptgoraphy
    - for confidentiality

  symmetric
    - 1 key same key
    - good for speed, and large data

  assymetric
    - 2 keys different keys
    - slower process, but with far better security
    - PKI's

  Public Keys
    - anybody can access it, designed for public
  Private Keys
    - for the recipient only
  Recovery Keys
    - a duplication of a private key
    - stored in "Key Escrow"
    - need a recovery agent in order to access the "Key Escrow"

Encryption
  - Converts information into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access
  - different levels of encryption offer varying degrees of protection
    - full-disk encryption secures an entire hard drive, including data, files, and the operating systems
    - partition encryption involves treating portions of a disk as separate units
    - file encryption, or encrypting individual files, adds an additional layer of security

Transport/Communication
  - Data security and encryption is essential, whether the data is at rest, in transit, or in use.
