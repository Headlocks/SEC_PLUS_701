Business Proccesses Impacting Security Operations
  - Business Processes are the organized steps that companies use to achieve their goals or provide services effectively.
    -impact on security operations
      - if the approval process isnt robust, it could lead to changes that introduce vulnerabilties
      - clear ownership protocols ensure that each asset has someone responsible for its security

Approval Process, Ownership, and Stakeholders
  Approval Process
    - determines how security affecting changes are authorized and who has the authority to make those decisions
  Ownership
    - refers to the individual or team responsible for specific assets and accountable for their security
  Stakeholders
    - individuals or grups with vested inerest in an organizations security practices

Impact Analysis and Test Results
  impact analysis
    - involves evaluating the potential effects of changes on an organizations security landscape

  test results  
    - activities like penetration tets, vulnerability assessments, and simulated attacks provide critical insights into the effectiveness of newly implemented security measres

Backout Plan, Maintenance Window, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

  Backout Plan
    - detailed procedure aimed at reversing changes that negatively affect security or business operations in IT systems or processes

  Maintenence Window
    - scheduled timeframe for implementing system updates or changes, chosen strategically to minimize disruptions

  SOPs
    - step-by-step instruction sets designed to guide workers through complex routine operations, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices

Technical Implications
  - encompass the potential consequences of technology-related dcisions or events within teh cybersecurity landscape
    - changes to network infrastructure
    - adjustments to security protocols
    - requirements for increasing server capacity due to new software or systems

Allow Lists & Block Lists/Deny Lists
  Allow Lists (or whitelists are lists of approved inputs that are permitted to be intered on a system)
  Block Lists (or deny lists are collections of specific elements, characters, or patterns that cannot be input

Restricted Activities
  - are specific actions or operations within a computer or network system that are limited or prohibited to maintain cybersecurity standards
    - these restrictions are typically introduced during employee onboarding through key documentaion like acceptable use policies (AUPs)

Downtime, Service Restart, Application Restart

  Downtime
    - periods when a system, network, software application is unavailable
  service restart    
    - involves stopping and retarting a system service to implement updates, patches, or configuration changes
  application restart
    - like a service restart but it involves restarting a specific software application

Legacy Applications and Dependencies
  Legacy applications
    - older software programs that continue to play a critical role in an organizations operations
  dependencies
    - relationships in which one component or service relies on another for proper functioning

Documentation
  - written material that provides information about systems or processes
    - user guides
    - technical specificiations
    - system descriptions

Updating Diagrams
  Diagrams
    - serve as maps or blueprints of networks or process flowcharts, providing visual representations
      - updating diagrams involves editing existing diagrams of systems or networks to reflect any changes since the diagrams creation
      - poorly documented changes can lead to instability and downtime

Updating Policies/Procedures

  Policies
    - dictate the rules governing the use of security of IT systems
  Procedures
    - outline the specific steps to implement these rules
      - regular revision of policies and procedures is essential to keep them aligned with technological advancements, environmental changes, or system modifications

version control
  - a system that records changes made to a file or set of files over time
    - allows users to:
      - track modifications
      - identify when and by whom changes were made
      - rever to earlier versions if necessary
