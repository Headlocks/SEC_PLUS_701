## Chapter 3: Change Management Security Impact

### Business Processes Impacting Security Operations
- **Business Processes** are the organized steps that companies use to achieve their goals or provide services effectively.
  - **Impact on Security Operations:**
    - If the approval process isn't robust, it could lead to changes that introduce vulnerabilities.
    - Clear ownership protocols ensure that each asset has someone responsible for its security.

### Approval Process, Ownership, and Stakeholders
- **Approval Process:**
  - Determines how security-affecting changes are authorized and who has the authority to make those decisions.
- **Ownership:**
  - Refers to the individual or team responsible for specific assets and accountable for their security.
- **Stakeholders:**
  - Individuals or groups with a vested interest in an organization's security practices.

### Impact Analysis and Test Results
- **Impact Analysis:**
  - Involves evaluating the potential effects of changes on an organization's security landscape.
- **Test Results:**
  - Activities like penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, and simulated attacks provide critical insights into the effectiveness of newly implemented security measures.

### Backout Plan, Maintenance Window, and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
- **Backout Plan:**
  - Detailed procedure aimed at reversing changes that negatively affect security or business operations in IT systems or processes.
- **Maintenance Window:**
  - Scheduled timeframe for implementing system updates or changes, chosen strategically to minimize disruptions.
- **SOPs:**
  - Step-by-step instruction sets designed to guide workers through complex routine operations, ensuring consistency and adherence to best practices.

### Technical Implications
- Encompass the potential consequences of technology-related decisions or events within the cybersecurity landscape:
  - Changes to network infrastructure.
  - Adjustments to security protocols.
  - Requirements for increasing server capacity due to new software or systems.

### Allow Lists & Block Lists/Deny Lists
- **Allow Lists (Whitelists):**
  - Lists of approved inputs that are permitted to be entered on a system.
- **Block Lists (Deny Lists):**
  - Collections of specific elements, characters, or patterns that cannot be input.

### Restricted Activities
- Specific actions or operations within a computer or network system that are limited or prohibited to maintain cybersecurity standards:
  - These restrictions are typically introduced during employee onboarding through key documentation like acceptable use policies (AUPs).

### Downtime, Service Restart, and Application Restart
- **Downtime:**
  - Periods when a system, network, or software application is unavailable.
- **Service Restart:**
  - Involves stopping and restarting a system service to implement updates, patches, or configuration changes.
- **Application Restart:**
  - Similar to a service restart but involves restarting a specific software application.

### Legacy Applications and Dependencies
- **Legacy Applications:**
  - Older software programs that continue to play a critical role in an organization's operations.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Relationships in which one component or service relies on another for proper functioning.

### Documentation
- Written material that provides information about systems or processes:
  - User guides.
  - Technical specifications.
  - System descriptions.

### Updating Diagrams
- Diagrams serve as maps or blueprints of networks or process flowcharts, providing visual representations:
  - Updating diagrams involves editing existing diagrams of systems or networks to reflect any changes since the diagram's creation.
  - Poorly documented changes can lead to instability and downtime.

### Updating Policies/Procedures
- **Policies:**
  - Dictate the rules governing the use of security of IT systems.
- **Procedures:**
  - Outline the specific steps to implement these rules:
    - Regular revision of policies and procedures is essential to keep them aligned with technological advancements, environmental changes, or system modifications.

### Version Control
- A system that records changes made to a file or set of files over time:
  - Allows users to:
    - Track modifications.
    - Identify when and by whom changes were made.
    - Revert to earlier versions if necessary.
