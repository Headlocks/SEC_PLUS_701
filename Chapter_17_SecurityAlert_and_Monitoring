## Chapter 17: Security Alerting and Monitoring Concepts and Tools

### Monitoring and Computing Resources
- **System monitoring**
  - Ensures the entire system (servers, devices, and workstations) is vulnerability-free and performing optimally.
- **Application monitoring**
  - Ensures software applications are secure, responsive, and optimized for performance.
- **Infrastructure monitoring**
  - Ensures cohesive and secure operation of all technological components within an organization.

### Log Aggregation
- Involves gathering log data from various sources into a centralized repository for examination.
  - Critical process
  - Helps turn isolated data points into a coherent narrative.
- Log aggregation tools and processes:
  - SIEM
  - syslog-ng (can be added to SIEM)
  - rsyslog (similar to SIEM)

### Alerting
- Acts as the early warning system for security infrastructure.
  - Using predefined rules, alerts indicate when immediate attention is required.
  - Alert tuning refers to setting the alert sensitivity.
    - If too stringent, genuine alerts are likely to be ignored among many false positives.
    - If too lax, alerts may not trigger when genuine threats occur.

### Scanning 
- Proactive measure for identifying potential weaknesses in systems, applications, and networks.
  - Comprehensive; scanning checks for open ports, outdated software, weak email passwords, and more.
  - Following remediation, scan again to ensure that new vulnerabilities didn't result from the fix.
  - Automated scanners:
    - Nessus
    - OpenVAS
    - Qualys

### Reporting
- Translates technical cybersecurity information for stakeholders.
  - Essential for daily decision-making, resource allocation, and strategic planning.
  - When creating reports, consider your audience (IT or executives):
    - **Technical reports**
      - Provide detailed breakdowns of vulnerabilities, affected systems, and recommended actions for IT.
    - **Executive reports**
      - Focus on potential business impacts and make recommendations for strategic risk mitigation.

### Archiving
- Securely storing historical data for long-term retrieval and analysis.
  - Digital version of a well-organized filing cabinet.
    - Quick access to documents when needed for work and auditing.
  - Considerations:
    - What data to store
    - Storage duration
    - Data storage security

### Alert Response and Remediation/Validation
- **Alert response**
  - Involves validating whether an alert indicates a genuine security threat or a false positive, and then remediating if needed.
    - **Quarantining**
      - Isolating suspicious files or problematic system activities in a secure environment.
    - **Alert tuning**
      - Continually refining alerts to have a robust and responsive system.

### Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)
- Standardized solution for security automation, helps implement best practices.
  - SCAP specifications:
    - Languages: OVAL, XCCDF, OCIL, AI, ARF
    - Enumerations: CVE, CPE, CCE
    - Metrics: CVSS, CCSS

### Benchmarks
- Standard points of reference for assessing a system's security level.
  - Setting a baseline security posture
  - Maintaining consistency across an organization's systems
  - Identifying and tracking measurements for improvement
  - Making security comparisons with industry peers and competitors

### Agents/Agentless
- **Agent-based solution**
  - Software agent is installed on each monitored system.
  - Sends data to a centralized management system.
  - Offers in-depth data and control, but may use extensive resources and be complex to deploy.
- **Agentless solution**
  - Monitors and manages systems without requiring software agents on each system.
  - Uses existing protocols for remote tasks.
  - Simple to implement and has a light footprint.
  - Provides less insight and control.

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Specialized device or software for security monitoring. It collects, correlates, and analyzes logs from multiple systems.
  - SIEM functions:
    - Log collection
    - Log normalization
    - Log aggregation
    - Log correlation
    - Reporting

### NetFlow
- Protocol that collects and monitors network traffic data.
  - Provides various traffic insights:
    - Source
    - Destination
    - Volume
    - Paths
  - Essential for traffic profiling and anomaly detection.

### Antivirus Software
- Prevents, detects, and removes malware.
  - Also known as anti-malware.
  - Viruses and trojans can damage networks and are costly to overcome; ransomware alone has cost victims billions of dollars.
  - Every endpoint device, including workstations, tablets, and phones, should have antivirus software to ensure comprehensive protection.

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Comprehensive data protection strategy that uses tools to detect potential data breaches and prevent exfiltration.
  - Monitors, detects, and blocks data in use, in motion, and at rest.
  - Enforces policies defined by regulatory bodies:
    - HIPAA
    - PCI DSS
    - GDPR

### Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Traps
- SNMPv3 is a popular protocol for managing and monitoring networks. SNMP traps are alerts sent from SNMP-enabled devices when they have status changes, facilitating speedy response.
  - Optional SNMPv3 features:
    - **Authentication**
      - Verifies the legitimacy of trap sources, preventing unauthorized devices from sending false alerts.
    - **Encryption**
      - Offers encryption to maintain the confidentiality of trap content.

### Vulnerability Scanners
- Automate the identification of weaknesses in systems and networks.
  - Work as digital sentries by constantly monitoring.
  - Stages of vulnerability scanning:
    - Pre-assessment
    - Scanning
    - Post-scan analysis
    - Remediation and verification
    - Continuous monitoring
