## Chapter 17: Security Alerting and Monitoring Concepts and Tools

Monitoring and Computing Resources
  - means continously overseeing an organization's IT assets to ensure they operate within normal parameters
    - system monitoring
      - ensures the entire system (servers, devices, and workstations) is vulnerability-free and performing optimally
    - application monitoring
      - ensures software applications are secure, responsive, and optimized for performance
    - infrastructure monitoring
      - ensures cohesive and secure operation of all technological components within an organization

log aggregation
  - involves gathering log data from various sources into a centralized repository for examination
    - critical process
    - helps turn isolated data points into a coherent narrative
  - log aggregation tools and processes
    - SIEM
    - syslog-ng (can be added to SIEM)
    - rsyslog (similar to SIEM)

alerting
  - is the early warning system for security infrastructure
    - using predefined rules, alerts indicate when immediate attention is required
    - alert turning refers to setting the alert sensitivity
      - if to stringent, genuine alerts are likely to be ignored among many false positive
      - if too lax, alerts may not trigger when genuine threats occur

scanning 
  - is a proactive measure for identifying potential weaknesses in systems, applications, and networks
    - comprehensive; scanning checks for open ports, outdated software, weak email passwords, and more
    - following remediation, scan again to ensure that new vulnerabilities didn't result from the fix
    - automated scanners
      - nessus
      - openVAS
      - qualys

reporting
  - translates rechnical cybersecurity information for stakeholders
    - essential for daily decision-making, resource allocation, and strategic planning
    - when creating reports, consider your audients (IT or executives)
      - technical reports 
        - give detailed breakdowns of vulnerabilities, affected systems, and recommended actions for IT
      - Executive reports
        - focus on potential business impacts and make recommendations for strategic risk mitigation

archiving
  - securely storing historical data for long-term retrieval and analysis
    - digital version of a well-organized filing cabinet
      - quick access to documents when needed for work and auditing
    - considerations
      - what data to store
      - storage duration
      - data storage security

alert response and remediation/validation
  - alert response
    - involves validating whether an alert indicates a genuine security threat or a false positive, and then remediating if needed
      - quarantining
        - isolating suspicious files or problematic system activities in a secure environment
      - alert tuning
        - continually refining alerts to have a robust and response system

security content automation protocol (SCAP)
  - is a standardized solution for security automation. it helps implement best practices. for example, it ensure that patches have been applied
    - scap specificiations
      - languages: OVAL, XCCDF, OCIL, AI, ARF
      - Enumerations: CVE, CPE, CCE
      - Metrics, CVSS,CCSS

Benchmarks
  - are standard points of reference for assessing a system's security level. referring to such guidelines can be helpful with:
    - setting a baseline security posture
    - maintaining consistency across an organization's sytems
    - identifying and tracking measurements for improvement
    - making security comparisons with industry peers and competitors

agents/agentless
  - agent-based solution
    - software agent is installed on each monitored system
    - sends data to a centralized management system
    - offers in-depth data and control, but may use extensive resources and be complex to deploy
  - agentless solution
    - monitors and manages systems without requiring software agents on each system
    - uses existing protocols for remote tasks
    - simple to implement and has a light footprint
    - provides less insight and control

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
  - specialized device or software for security monitoring. it collects, correlates, and analyzes logs from multiple systems
    - SIEM functions
      - log collection
      - log normalization
      - log aggregation
      - log correlation
      - reporting

netflow
  - protocol that collects and monitors network traffic data
    - provides various traffic insights
      - source
      - destination
      - volume
      - paths
    - essential for traffic profiling and anomaly detection

antivirus software
  - prevents, detects, and removes malware
    - also known as anti-malware
    - viruses and trojans can damage networks and are costly to overcome; ransomware alone has cost victims billions of dollars
    - every endpoint device, including worksations, tablets, and phones, should have antivirus software to ensure comprehensive protection

data loss prevention (DLP)
  - comprehensive data protection strategy that uses tools to detect potential data breaches and prevent exfiltration
    - monitors, detects, and blocks data in use, in motion, and at rest
    - enforces policies defined by regulatory bodies
      - HIPPA
      - PCI DCS
      - GDPR

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Traps
  - SNMPv3 is a popular protocol for managing and monitoring networks. SNMP traps are alerts sent from SNMP-enabled devices when they have status changes. this facilitates speedy response.
    - optional SNMPv3 features
      - authentication
        - verifies the legitimacy of trap sources, preventing unauthorized devices from sending false alerts
      - encryption
        - offers encryption to maintain the confidentiality of trap content

vulnrability scanners
  - automate the identification of weaknesses in systems and networks
    - work as digital sentries by constantly monitoring
    - stages of vulnerability scanning
      - pre-assessment
      - scanning
      - post-scan anlysis
      - remediation and verification
      - continuous monitoring
