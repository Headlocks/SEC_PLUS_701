## Chapter 28: Implementing Security Awareness Practices

Phishing
  - Social Engineering attack aimed at tricking individuals into shareing sensitive data
    - often conducted via email, messaging apps, and websites
    - user education and awareness are vital to keeping systems secure

signs of phishing attempts
  - mismatched URLs
  - Errors in grammar and spelling
  - Requests for sensitive information
  - unexpected attachements
  - "too good to be true" offers

suspicious message protocol
  - 1) isolate the threat
  - 2) analyze the content
  - 3) notify security team
  - 4) make users aware
  - 5) update security measures

anomalous behavior recognition
  - identifies actions or patterns deviating from established norms in a network or system
    - may indicate malicious threats or unintentional (but still risky) behaviors
    - crucial for preemptive threat detection

anomoalous behaviors
  - unexpected behaviors
    - deviations form established norms or baseline behaviors
      - unusual login times
      - high data transfer rates
      - multiple failed login attempts
  - risky behaviors
    - actions that expose an organization to vulnerabilities or therats; may be deliberate or have malicious intent
  - unintentional behaviors
    - actions that inadvertently jeopardize cybersecurity; usually involve lack of awareness

user guidance and training
  - empowers employees with security knowledge and training to help protect the organization
    - policy documents
      - acceptable use policy (AUP)
      - information security policy (ISP)
      - Remote/Hybrid work policies
      - incident response handbook
    - training
      - password management
      - social engineering
      - insider threats
      - operational security

reporting and monitoring
  - are both initial and recurring
    - initial reporting
      - documenting and communicating details of security incidents or vulnerabilities as the first response
    - initial monitoring
      - working to contain a threat that with help of real-time log data
    - recurring reporting
      - periodically reviewing and auditing to assess security measures
    - recurring monitoring
      - continuously scanning networks and systems for new vulnerabilities and threats

development phase
  - lay the groundwork for a security awareness program by defining its objectives, scop, and measurable goals
    - create a detailed project plan outlining a timeline, resources, and budget
    - identify key stakeholdres and define their roles
    - create training materials and assessments

execution phase
  - put the security awareness program into action
    - use real-time monitoring to ensure the program is effective
    - make program adjustments as needed
    - periodically review the program to keep it relevant and effective
