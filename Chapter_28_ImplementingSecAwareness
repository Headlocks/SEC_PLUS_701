## Chapter 28: Implementing Security Awareness Practices

### Phishing
- Social Engineering attack aimed at tricking individuals into sharing sensitive data
  - Often conducted via email, messaging apps, and websites
  - User education and awareness are vital to keeping systems secure

### Signs of Phishing Attempts
- Mismatched URLs
- Errors in grammar and spelling
- Requests for sensitive information
- Unexpected attachments
- "Too good to be true" offers

### Suspicious Message Protocol
1. Isolate the threat
2. Analyze the content
3. Notify the security team
4. Make users aware
5. Update security measures

### Anomalous Behavior Recognition
- Identifies actions or patterns deviating from established norms in a network or system
  - May indicate malicious threats or unintentional (but still risky) behaviors
  - Crucial for preemptive threat detection

### Anomalous Behaviors
- Unexpected Behaviors
  - Deviations from established norms or baseline behaviors
    - Unusual login times
    - High data transfer rates
    - Multiple failed login attempts
- Risky Behaviors
  - Actions that expose an organization to vulnerabilities or threats; may be deliberate or have malicious intent
- Unintentional Behaviors
  - Actions that inadvertently jeopardize cybersecurity; usually involve lack of awareness

### User Guidance and Training
- Empowers employees with security knowledge and training to help protect the organization
  - Policy Documents
    - Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
    - Information Security Policy (ISP)
    - Remote/Hybrid Work Policies
    - Incident Response Handbook
  - Training
    - Password management
    - Social engineering
    - Insider threats
    - Operational security

### Reporting and Monitoring
- Are both initial and recurring
  - Initial Reporting
    - Documenting and communicating details of security incidents or vulnerabilities as the first response
  - Initial Monitoring
    - Working to contain a threat with the help of real-time log data
  - Recurring Reporting
    - Periodically reviewing and auditing to assess security measures
  - Recurring Monitoring
    - Continuously scanning networks and systems for new vulnerabilities and threats

### Development Phase
- Lay the groundwork for a security awareness program by defining its objectives, scope, and measurable goals
  - Create a detailed project plan outlining a timeline, resources, and budget
  - Identify key stakeholders and define their roles
  - Create training materials and assessments

### Execution Phase
- Put the security awareness program into action
  - Use real-time monitoring to ensure the program is effective
  - Make program adjustments as needed
  - Periodically review the program to keep it relevant and effective
