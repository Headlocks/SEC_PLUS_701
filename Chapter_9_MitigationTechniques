## Chapter 9: Mitigation Techniques to secure the Enterprise

Segmentation 
  - divides a computer network into subnetworks or segments. it enhances security through isolation, limiting access to sensitive information
    for proper implementation:
      - understand data flows
      - understand business needs
      - adhere to policies and protocols

Access Control Lists (ACLs) 
  - can grant or deny network resource permissions to specific IP addresses, proocols, or ports
  network ACLs can operate at different levels of the OSI model
    - layer 2
    - layer 3
    - layer 4

Permissions
  - define the rights to preform actions on a system and are associated with files, directories, or processes
    windows
      - permisions are managed using security identifiers (SIDs) and ACLs
    linux
      - file permissions are presented symbolically or numerically. linux has fewer permissions than windows
    best practices
      - best practice for permissions include granting them to security groups rather than individual users and using central management for easier control

isolation
  - is the process of separating a suspected infected device from the rest of the computing environment
  considerations when dealing with a compromised endpoint
    - does it hold data that cannot be obtained from another source?
    - can you safely reimage the device?
    - can you wait until the investigation is completed before attempting any action?

patching
  - involves updating or fixing software applications, drivers, and operating systems by applying patches or updates
    - updates can address known security vulnerabilities, enhance performance, and introduce new features
    - regular patching is crucial for system security
    - industries vary in their approaches to patching based on operational demands and threat environments

encryption
  - converts information into a coded form, rendering it unreadable without the correct decryption key or algorithm
    - prevents unauthorized access
    - safeguards teh confidentiality and integrity of data

monitoring
  - the ongoing observation and anlysis of systems activties to identify and respond to potential security incidents
  offers real-time insights into system activities
    - network traffic
    - user behavior
    - system performance
    - logs

least privilege
  - the principle of least privilege advocates for granting individuals or systems only the necessary access or permissions to perform their tasks
    - limiting access to the minimal level needed reduces potential damage from errors and malicious actions
    examples
      - in a hospital, nurses may access patient medical records but not financial data
      - IT technicians may update system software but cannot access HR records

Configuration Enforcement
  - ensures that system settings, policies, and controls are consistently applied throughout an organizations network, systems, and devices
  stategies for enforcement
    - group policy
    - ensuring uniform compliance with security standards
    - reducing exploitable weaknesses such as common passwords

decommissioning
  - involves the planned removal of hardware, software, or subystems from active service as part of lifecycle management
    - essential when systems reach the end of their usable life or become obsolete
    - mitigates security risks by safely retiring obsolte or unused systems without leaving vulnerabilities for exploitation
    - may require physical destruction of hardware

Hardening Techniques
  - systematic measures to minimize the attack surfaces of systems and reduce vulnerabilities
    encryption
      - transform data into a coded form to protect confidentiality and integrity, both in storage and transmission
    installation of endpoint protection
      - deploy security solutions tailored to defend user devices against malware, phishing, and other threats
    host-based firewalls
      - install software firewalls on individual devices to control incoming and outgoing traffic
    host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS)
        - provide real-time protection against known and unknown threats by monitoring host system behavior
    disable ports/protocols
        - identify and close unused or unnecessary ports and protocols to limit potential entry points for attackers
    change default passwords
        - change default credentials to solid and unique credentials to prevent unauthorized access
    remove unnecessary software
        - identify and remove unused or outdated software to reduce potential vulnerabilities
