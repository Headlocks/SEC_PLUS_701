## Chapter 9: Mitigation Techniques to Secure the Enterprise

### Segmentation
- Divides a computer network into subnetworks or segments. It enhances security through isolation, limiting access to sensitive information.
  - For proper implementation:
    - Understand data flows
    - Understand business needs
    - Adhere to policies and protocols

### Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Can grant or deny network resource permissions to specific IP addresses, protocols, or ports.
- Network ACLs can operate at different levels of the OSI model:
  - Layer 2
  - Layer 3
  - Layer 4

### Permissions
- Define the rights to perform actions on a system and are associated with files, directories, or processes.
  - **Windows:**
    - Permissions are managed using security identifiers (SIDs) and ACLs.
  - **Linux:**
    - File permissions are presented symbolically or numerically. Linux has fewer permissions than Windows.
  - **Best Practices:**
    - Grant permissions to security groups rather than individual users.
    - Use central management for easier control.

### Isolation
- The process of separating a suspected infected device from the rest of the computing environment.
  - Considerations when dealing with a compromised endpoint:
    - Does it hold data that cannot be obtained from another source?
    - Can you safely reimage the device?
    - Can you wait until the investigation is completed before attempting any action?

### Patching
- Involves updating or fixing software applications, drivers, and operating systems by applying patches or updates.
  - Updates can address known security vulnerabilities, enhance performance, and introduce new features.
  - Regular patching is crucial for system security.
  - Industries vary in their approaches to patching based on operational demands and threat environments.

### Encryption
- Converts information into a coded form, rendering it unreadable without the correct decryption key or algorithm.
  - Prevents unauthorized access.
  - Safeguards the confidentiality and integrity of data.

### Monitoring
- The ongoing observation and analysis of system activities to identify and respond to potential security incidents.
  - Offers real-time insights into system activities:
    - Network traffic
    - User behavior
    - System performance
    - Logs

### Least Privilege
- The principle of least privilege advocates for granting individuals or systems only the necessary access or permissions to perform their tasks.
  - Limiting access to the minimal level needed reduces potential damage from errors and malicious actions.
  - Examples:
    - In a hospital, nurses may access patient medical records but not financial data.
    - IT technicians may update system software but cannot access HR records.

### Configuration Enforcement
- Ensures that system settings, policies, and controls are consistently applied throughout an organization's network, systems, and devices.
  - Strategies for enforcement:
    - Group policy
    - Ensuring uniform compliance with security standards
    - Reducing exploitable weaknesses such as common passwords

### Decommissioning
- Involves the planned removal of hardware, software, or subsystems from active service as part of lifecycle management.
  - Essential when systems reach the end of their usable life or become obsolete.
  - Mitigates security risks by safely retiring obsolete or unused systems without leaving vulnerabilities for exploitation.
  - May require physical destruction of hardware.

### Hardening Techniques
- Systematic measures to minimize the attack surfaces of systems and reduce vulnerabilities:
  - **Encryption:**
    - Transform data into a coded form to protect confidentiality and integrity, both in storage and transmission.
  - **Installation of Endpoint Protection:**
    - Deploy security solutions tailored to defend user devices against malware, phishing, and other threats.
  - **Host-Based Firewalls:**
    - Install software firewalls on individual devices to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
  - **Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS):**
    - Provide real-time protection against known and unknown threats by monitoring host system behavior.
  - **Disable Ports/Protocols:**
    - Identify and close unused or unnecessary ports and protocols to limit potential entry points for attackers.
  - **Change Default Passwords:**
    - Change default credentials to solid and unique credentials to prevent unauthorized access.
  - **Remove Unnecessary Software:**
    - Identify and remove unused or outdated software to reduce potential vulnerabilities.
