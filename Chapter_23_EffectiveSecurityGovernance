## Chapter 23: Summarizing Elements of Effective Security Governance

Guidelines
  - are general recommendations aimed at steering organizational behavior and decision making
    - provide directional advice; suggestions and best practices for various security-related activites
    - more relaxed than policies or standards, allowing for flexibility in implementation

Policies
  - formal, high-level statements or plans that outline an organization's general beliefs, goals, objectives, and acceptable procedures
    - essential for setting the organization's approaches to various issues
    - govern various aspects of business, include employee behavior and emergency procedures

Types of Policies
  - Acceptable use Policy (AUP)
    - defines rules for the use of technology infrastructure
      - may conflict with a BYOD policy
  - information security policy
    - provides guidelines and procedures for protecting data and technology assets
      - examples
        - password policy
        - software update policy
  - business continuity policy
    - aims to ensure that essential operations continue despite a disruption
      - examples
        - daily remote backup policy
        - crisis communications policy
  - disaster recovery plan
    - focuses on restoring IT infrastructure and operations post-crisis
      - example:
        - data recovery policy
  - incident response policy
    - outlines procedures to follow during cybersecurity incidents
      - example:
        - quarantine policy
  - software development lifecycle (SDLC) policy
    - governs the software development process, incorporating security and quality at every phase
      - examples:
        - coding policy
        - software retirement policy
  - change management policy
    - guides how changes to IT systems and processes are proposed, reviewed, and implemented
      - example:
        - requiring board approval for an IT system change

standards
  - provide specific, detailed instructions for implementing security measures
    - help ensure that practicies align with policies
    - promote consistency and uniformity in security implementation

types of standards
  - password standards
    - defines rules for creating, managing, and storing passwords
  - access control standards
    - determine who has access to specific resources within the organization's network and systems
      - attribute-based access control (ABAC)
      - Role-based access control (RBAC)
      - Discretionary access control (DAC)
      - Mandatory access control (MAC)
  - physical security standards
    - safeguard tangible assets like buildings, hardware, and personnel
  - encrypted standards
    - govern how data should be encrypted and decrypted within the organization

procedures
  - implement policies and standards through specific, detailed instructions
    - change management procedures
      - help transition individuals, teams, and the organization to a desired state
        - proposal
        - planning
        - testing
        - implementation
        - review
  - onboarding and offboarding procedures
    - help integrate users or remove them from identity and access management systems
      - examples:
        - background checks
        - user training
        - adding or removing user permissions
  - playbooks
    - step-by-step guides to approaching various security scenarios. they aim to minimize the impacts of emergency incidents
      - typical sections
        - incident identification
        - assessment
        - response strategy
        - recovery and restoration
        - lessons learned

external considerations
  - factors outside an organization that influence its security governance
    - regulatory
      - industry-specific rules dictating various aspects of business operations (HIPAA)
    - legal
      - broader than regulatory; include a range of obligations and potential liabilities such as consumer data privacy laws and vendor contracts
    - industry
      - guidelines best practices, or requirements within an industry (such as following the PCI DSS)
    - Local/Regional
      - rules, regulations, and cultural norms that only apply to a certain geographic area
    - national
      - laws, regulations, and standards applicable within a country
    - global
      - laws, treaties, and standards that apply to organizations operating in multiple countries

monitoring and revision
  - continous monitoring
    - involves regular log reviews, audits, and peformance metric analysis
  - revision
    - is the implementation of change in response to monitoring
      - security information and event management (SIEM) systems help aggregate and analyze data for monitoring
      - well-defined processes for monitoring and revision help organizations adapt to new conditions

types of governance structures
  - board
    - sets strategic direction, approves policies, oversees risk management, ensures legal compliance
  - committee
    - provides detailed oversight, advises on specific issues, monitors and audits, facilitates stakeholder communication
  - government entities
    - set standards and regulations, enforce legal compliance, collaborate with private sector; subject to oversight committees
  - centralized governance
    - concentrates decision making authority, allows for uniform implementation. may lack responsiveness and can create a single point of failure
  - decentralized governance
    - distributes decision making authority, fostering innovation and adaptability. may lead to inconsistencies and gaps in security

roles and responsibilities for systems and data
  - owners
    - responsible for asset classification, policy formulation, risk assessment, compliance oversight, budget allocation, and incident response
  - controllers
    - define data processing objectives, ensure legal compliance, maintain data quality, oversee security measures, facilitate data subject rights, and maintain accountability and recordkeeping
  - processors
    - handle data according to controller directives, implement security measures, ensure data accuracy, somply with legal and regulatory requirements, providing reporting and documentation, and respond to security incidents
  - custodians/stewards
    - implement and maintain security measures, ensure data quality, assist in compliance efforts, manage data storage and backups, and provide evidence for audits
