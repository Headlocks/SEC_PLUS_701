## Chapter 23: Summarizing Elements of Effective Security Governance

### Guidelines
- Are general recommendations aimed at steering organizational behavior and decision-making.
  - Provide directional advice, suggestions, and best practices for various security-related activities.
  - More relaxed than policies or standards, allowing for flexibility in implementation.

### Policies
- Formal, high-level statements or plans that outline an organization's general beliefs, goals, objectives, and acceptable procedures.
  - Essential for setting the organization's approaches to various issues.
  - Govern various aspects of business, including employee behavior and emergency procedures.

#### Types of Policies
- **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**
  - Defines rules for the use of technology infrastructure.
    - May conflict with a BYOD policy.
- **Information Security Policy**
  - Provides guidelines and procedures for protecting data and technology assets.
    - Examples:
      - Password policy.
      - Software update policy.
- **Business Continuity Policy**
  - Aims to ensure that essential operations continue despite a disruption.
    - Examples:
      - Daily remote backup policy.
      - Crisis communications policy.
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**
  - Focuses on restoring IT infrastructure and operations post-crisis.
    - Example:
      - Data recovery policy.
- **Incident Response Policy**
  - Outlines procedures to follow during cybersecurity incidents.
    - Example:
      - Quarantine policy.
- **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Policy**
  - Governs the software development process, incorporating security and quality at every phase.
    - Examples:
      - Coding policy.
      - Software retirement policy.
- **Change Management Policy**
  - Guides how changes to IT systems and processes are proposed, reviewed, and implemented.
    - Example:
      - Requiring board approval for an IT system change.

### Standards
- Provide specific, detailed instructions for implementing security measures.
  - Help ensure that practices align with policies.
  - Promote consistency and uniformity in security implementation.

#### Types of Standards
- **Password Standards**
  - Defines rules for creating, managing, and storing passwords.
- **Access Control Standards**
  - Determine who has access to specific resources within the organization's network and systems.
    - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC).
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
    - Discretionary Access Control (DAC).
    - Mandatory Access Control (MAC).
- **Physical Security Standards**
  - Safeguard tangible assets like buildings, hardware, and personnel.
- **Encryption Standards**
  - Govern how data should be encrypted and decrypted within the organization.

### Procedures
- Implement policies and standards through specific, detailed instructions.
  - **Change Management Procedures**
    - Help transition individuals, teams, and the organization to a desired state.
      - Proposal.
      - Planning.
      - Testing.
      - Implementation.
      - Review.
  - **Onboarding and Offboarding Procedures**
    - Help integrate users or remove them from identity and access management systems.
      - Examples:
        - Background checks.
        - User training.
        - Adding or removing user permissions.
  - **Playbooks**
    - Step-by-step guides to approaching various security scenarios. They aim to minimize the impacts of emergency incidents.
      - Typical sections:
        - Incident identification.
        - Assessment.
        - Response strategy.
        - Recovery and restoration.
        - Lessons learned.

### External Considerations
- Factors outside an organization that influence its security governance.
  - **Regulatory**
    - Industry-specific rules dictating various aspects of business operations (e.g., HIPAA).
  - **Legal**
    - Broader than regulatory; include a range of obligations and potential liabilities such as consumer data privacy laws and vendor contracts.
  - **Industry**
    - Guidelines, best practices, or requirements within an industry (such as following the PCI DSS).
  - **Local/Regional**
    - Rules, regulations, and cultural norms that only apply to a certain geographic area.
  - **National**
    - Laws, regulations, and standards applicable within a country.
  - **Global**
    - Laws, treaties, and standards that apply to organizations operating in multiple countries.

### Monitoring and Revision
- **Continuous Monitoring**
  - Involves regular log reviews, audits, and performance metric analysis.
- **Revision**
  - The implementation of change in response to monitoring.
    - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems help aggregate and analyze data for monitoring.
    - Well-defined processes for monitoring and revision help organizations adapt to new conditions.

### Types of Governance Structures
- **Board**
  - Sets strategic direction, approves policies, oversees risk management, ensures legal compliance.
- **Committee**
  - Provides detailed oversight, advises on specific issues, monitors and audits, facilitates stakeholder communication.
- **Government Entities**
  - Set standards and regulations, enforce legal compliance, collaborate with the private sector; subject to oversight committees.
- **Centralized Governance**
  - Concentrates decision-making authority, allows for uniform implementation. May lack responsiveness and can create a single point of failure.
- **Decentralized Governance**
  - Distributes decision-making authority, fostering innovation and adaptability. May lead to inconsistencies and gaps in security.

### Roles and Responsibilities for Systems and Data
- **Owners**
  - Responsible for asset classification, policy formulation, risk assessment, compliance oversight, budget allocation, and incident response.
- **Controllers**
  - Define data processing objectives, ensure legal compliance, maintain data quality, oversee security measures, facilitate data subject rights, and maintain accountability and recordkeeping.
- **Processors**
  - Handle data according to controller directives, implement security measures, ensure data accuracy, comply with legal and regulatory requirements, providing reporting and documentation.
- **Custodians/Stewards**
  - Implement and maintain security measures, ensure data quality, assist in compliance efforts, manage data storage and backups, and provide evidence for audits.
