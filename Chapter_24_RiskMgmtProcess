## Chapter 24: Understanding Elements of the Risk Management Process

risk identification
  - systematically recognizing, documenting, and understanding potential threats, vulnerabilities, and hazards that could impact an organization's assets, opreations, or objectives
    - cybersecurity threats
    - natural distasters
    - regulatory risks
    - supply chain risks
    - human errors

risk assessment
  - evaluating identified risks to determine their potential likelihood and impact
    - ad hoc
    - recurring
    - one-time
    - continuous

risk analysis
  - delving deep into each identified risk, examining specific details and characteristics
    - 1) identify assets
    - 2) identify vulnerabilities
    - 3) identify threats and threat likelihood
    - 4) assess potential impact
  - risk register
    - useful for tracking issues and rememedies

risk matrix/heat map
  - correlation of impact and probablity

qualitative risk analysis vs quantitative risk analysis
  qualitative
    - assigns numeric values based on the probability and impact of risks, without assigning monetary values
    - uses ranegs to represent probability and impact, such as 1 to 10 or 1 to 100
  quantitative
    - assigns exact monetary values to risks and losses
    - calculates expected yearly loss in dollars for specific risks

quantitative risk calculations
  - three key values used in quantitativ risk calculations:
    - single lost expectancy (SLE)
      - the loss of value in dollars based on a single incident of a given type
    - annualized rate of occurrence (ARO)
      - the number of times per year that the type of incident occurs
    - annualized loss expectancy (ALE)
      - total loss in dollars per year from a type of incident
    - SLE x ARO = ALE

Exposure Factor (EF)
  - is the percentage of loss that an asset would experience if a threat materialized. it helps calculate SLE (single loss expectancy)
  - SLE = Asset value x EF

probablility vs likelihood
  - the terms are similar, but probability uses numbers
    - probability
      - quantifies the likelihood of a risk occuring. its often expressed as a percentage, and it can be used in calculations
    - likelihood
      - qualitatively describes the chance of an event occuring, often with a term like "likely" or "highly unlikely"

Risk Register
  - centralized repository for recording identified risks, their characteristics, and management plans. each risk receives a risk ID for easy tracking.
    -key risk indicators (KRIs)
      - metrics for measuring the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
    - risk owners
      - individuals or departments responsible for managing specific risks
    - risk threshold
      - level of risk that an organization is willing to accept before taking action

Risk Tolerance
  - the amount of risk an organization is willing to accept as it pursues objectives
    - shapes cybersecurity investment
    - low risk tolerance leads to heavy investment and multilayered security
    - high risk tolerance prioritized growth over stringent security protocols

risk appetite
  - level of risk an organization is willing to accept to pursue its objectives
    - expansionary 
      - willing to accept higher risk in exchange for rapid growth
    - conservative
      - prefers lower levels of risk, prioritizing staiblity and sutainable growth
    - neutral
      - balanced approach; accept risk, but not at the expense of stability

risk management strategies
  - systematic approaches to managing and mitigating risks
    - **accept** some or all consequences of the risk
    - **mitigate** the risk
    - **transfer** the risk to a third party
    - **avoid** the risk

risk reporting
  - documenting and sharing with stakeholders an organization's risk assessments, analysis findings, and risk management strategies
    - executive summary
    - detailed findings
    - recommendations
    - action plan

business impact analysis
  - business impact analysis (BIA)
    - determines potential impacts of interrupting critical processes
      - recovery time objective (RTO)
        - time by which a process should be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences
      - recovery point objective (RPO)
        - maximum amount of data that can be lost due to a disruption
      - mean time to repair (MTTR)
        - average time required to repair a failed device or system
      - Mean time between failures (MTBF)
        - expected average time between failures for a system or component
