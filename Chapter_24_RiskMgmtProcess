## Chapter 24: Understanding Elements of the Risk Management Process

### Risk Identification
- Systematically recognizing, documenting, and understanding potential threats, vulnerabilities, and hazards that could impact an organization's assets, operations, or objectives
  - Cybersecurity threats
  - Natural disasters
  - Regulatory risks
  - Supply chain risks
  - Human errors

### Risk Assessment
- Evaluating identified risks to determine their potential likelihood and impact
  - Ad hoc
  - Recurring
  - One-time
  - Continuous

### Risk Analysis
- Delving deep into each identified risk, examining specific details and characteristics
  - Identify assets
  - Identify vulnerabilities
  - Identify threats and threat likelihood
  - Assess potential impact
- Risk register
  - Useful for tracking issues and remedies

### Risk Matrix/Heat Map
- Correlation of impact and probability

### Qualitative Risk Analysis vs Quantitative Risk Analysis
#### Qualitative
- Assigns numeric values based on the probability and impact of risks, without assigning monetary values
- Uses ranges to represent probability and impact, such as 1 to 10 or 1 to 100

#### Quantitative
- Assigns exact monetary values to risks and losses
- Calculates expected yearly loss in dollars for specific risks

### Quantitative Risk Calculations
- Three key values used in quantitative risk calculations:
  - Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
    - The loss of value in dollars based on a single incident of a given type
  - Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
    - The number of times per year that the type of incident occurs
  - Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
    - Total loss in dollars per year from a type of incident
  - SLE x ARO = ALE

### Exposure Factor (EF)
- Percentage of loss that an asset would experience if a threat materialized. It helps calculate SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
- SLE = Asset value x EF

### Probability vs Likelihood
- The terms are similar, but probability uses numbers
  - Probability
    - Quantifies the likelihood of a risk occurring. It's often expressed as a percentage, and it can be used in calculations
  - Likelihood
    - Qualitatively describes the chance of an event occurring, often with a term like "likely" or "highly unlikely"

### Risk Register
- Centralized repository for recording identified risks, their characteristics, and management plans. Each risk receives a risk ID for easy tracking.
  - Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
    - Metrics for measuring the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
  - Risk owners
    - Individuals or departments responsible for managing specific risks
  - Risk threshold
    - Level of risk that an organization is willing to accept before taking action

### Risk Tolerance
- The amount of risk an organization is willing to accept as it pursues objectives
  - Shapes cybersecurity investment
  - Low risk tolerance leads to heavy investment and multilayered security
  - High risk tolerance prioritizes growth over stringent security protocols

### Risk Appetite
- Level of risk an organization is willing to accept to pursue its objectives
  - Expansionary
    - Willing to accept higher risk in exchange for rapid growth
  - Conservative
    - Prefers lower levels of risk, prioritizing stability and sustainable growth
  - Neutral
    - Balanced approach; accept risk, but not at the expense of stability

### Risk Management Strategies
- Systematic approaches to managing and mitigating risks
  - **Accept** some or all consequences of the risk
  - **Mitigate** the risk
  - **Transfer** the risk to a third party
  - **Avoid** the risk

### Risk Reporting
- Documenting and sharing with stakeholders an organization's risk assessments, analysis findings, and risk management strategies
  - Executive summary
  - Detailed findings
  - Recommendations
  - Action plan

### Business Impact Analysis
- Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
  - Determines potential impacts of interrupting critical processes
    - Recovery Time Objective (RTO)
      - Time by which a process should be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences
    - Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
      - Maximum amount of data that can be lost due to a disruption
    - Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
      - Average time required to repair a failed device or system
    - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
      - Expected average time between failures for a system or component
