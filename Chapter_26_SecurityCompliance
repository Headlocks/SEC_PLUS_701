## Chapter 26: Summarizing Elements of Effective Security Compliance

### Compliance Reporting
- Provides insights to internal stakeholders and fulfills external obligations by creating detailed documents.
  - Documents adhere to industry-specific regulations and standards.
  - Internal stakeholders might be interested in metrics involving employee security training and thwarted attacks.
  - External compliance reports are often required within strict time frames. Late or inaccurate reports may result in fines, legal action, and other negative consequences.

#### Compliance Reporting Examples
- **FCPA Compliance**
  - Shows measures taken to prevent corruption (due diligence programs and accounting controls).
- **PCI DSS Compliance**
  - Details how customer payment data is protected.
- **HIPAA Compliance**
  - Shows measures taken to protect patient health records.
- **GDPR Compliance**
  - Shows protocols for safeguarding personal data and privacy rights.

### Consequences of Non-Compliance
- **Fines**
  - Monetary penalties for non-compliance.
- **Sanctions**
  - Restrictions or limitations imposed on organizations until compliance is achieved.
- **Reputational Damage**
  - Negative impact on an organization's public image and credibility.

  - Uses internal and external monitoring mechanisms.
  - Is streamlined by automation.

### Due Diligence/Care
- **Due Diligence**

    - Applying information gathered during due diligence.
    - Updating security protocols.
    - Conducting regular audits.

### Attestation and Acknowledgment
- **Attestation**
  - Formal declaration or confirmation that specific criteria, processes, or systems meet the security standards.

### Automation in Compliance Monitoring
- Software can automate various tasks that help ensure compliance monitoring.
  - Examples:
    - Configuration management tools.
    - Automated vulnerability scanners.
    - SIEM systems.

### Privacy

  - Local and Regional Examples:
    - CCPA (California)
    - SHIELD Act (New York)
    - GDPR (European Union)
  - National Examples:

    - PIPEDA (Canada)

### Data Roles
- **Data Subject**

  - Processes personal data on behalf of the controller, complying with security measures.
- **Ownership**
  - Refers to who has legal rights and control over data (power to set access levels and give auditing permissions).

### Data Inventory and Retention
- **Data Inventory**
  - A catalog or map that identifies where different types of data are stored.
    - Crucial for risk assessment and data protection strategies.
- **Data Retention Policies**
  - Dictate how long specific data types should be stored.

### Right to be Forgotten
- Lets individuals request the deletion of their personal data. Security analysts follow up with data erasure in accordance with regulations.
  - Locate and erase specified data from all systems, including backups.
  - Run verification checks to confirm complete removal of data.
  - Keep detailed documentation of the entire process.
