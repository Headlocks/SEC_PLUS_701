## Chapter 26: Summarizing Elements of Effective Security Compliance

compliance reporting
  - provides insights to internal stakeholders and fulfills external obligations by creating detailed documents
    - documents adhere to industry-specific regulations and standards
    - internal stakeholders might be interested in metrics involving employee security training and thwarted attacks
    - external compliance reports are often required within strict time frames. late or inaccurate reports may result in fines, legal action, and other negative consequences

compliance reporting examples
  - FCPA compliance
    - shows measures taken to prevent corruption (due diligence programs and accounting controls)
  - PCI DSS Compliance
    - details how customer payment data is protected
  - HIPAA compliance
    - shows measures taken to protect patient health records
  - GDPR compliance
    - shows protocols for safeguarding personal data and privacy rights

consequences of non-compliance
  - fines
    - monetary penalties for non-compliance
  - sanctions
    - restrictions or limitations imposed on organizations until compliance is achieved
  - reputational damage
    - neegative impact on an organizations public image and credibility
  - loss of license
    - one of the most severe consequences; the organization might need to shut down
  - contractual impacts
    - contracts may be terminated and legal disputes may result from not complying with contractual obligations

compliance monitoring
  - ensuring adherence to regulatory guidelines and internal policies
    - involves a range of activities such as due diligence, attestation, and acknowledgement
    - uses internal and external monitoring mechanisms
    - is streamlined by automation

due diligence/care
  - due diligence
    - gather information and assessing risks before making decisions
      - includes comprehensive reviews of systems, processes, and policies to identify vulnerabilities
    - due care
      - maintaining established systems or processes
        - applying information gathered during due diligence
        - updating security protocols
        - conducting regular audits
    
attestation and acknowledgment
  - attestation
    - formal declaration or confirmation that specific criteria, processes, or systems meet the security standards
     - provides assurance that data is being handled securely
  - acknowledgement
    - formally accepting or recognizing a policy
      - compliance certificates and signed agreements are legally-binding acknowledgments that an organization will adhere to certain security protocols or standards

automation in compliance monitoring
  - software can automate various tasks that help ensure compliance monitoring.
    - examples:
      - configuration management tools
      - automated vulnerability scanners
      - SIEM systems

Privacy
  - an ethical obligation and a legal mandate
    - involves safeguarding data against unauthorized access and ensuring data is used properly
    - legal frameworks govern cybersecurity privacy at various jurisdictional levels

legal implications
  - an organization's responsibilities, liabilities, and potential penalties related to handling personal data. vary by jurisdiction, data type, and data use
    - local and regional examples
      - CCPA (California)
      - SHIELD Act (New York)
      - GDPR (European Union)
    - National Examples
      - COPPA (USA)
      - PIPEDA (Canada)

Data roles
  - data subject
    - an individual whose personal data is being processed
  - controller
    - decides how and why data will be processed
  - processor
    - processes personal data on behalf of the controller, complying with security measures
  - ownership
    - refers to who has legal rights and control over data (power to set access levels and give auditing permissions)

data inventory and retention
  - data inventory
    - a catalog or map that identifies where different types of data are stored
      - crucial for risk assessment and data protection strategies
  - data retention policies
    - dictate how long specific data types should be stored

right to be forgotten
  - lets individuals request the deletion of their personal data. security analysts follow up with data erasure in accordance with regulations
    - locate and erase specified data from all systems, including backups
    - run verification checks to confirm complete removal of data
    - keep detailed documentation of the entire process
