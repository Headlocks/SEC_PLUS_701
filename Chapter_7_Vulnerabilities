Application Layer
  - is a gateway to user interactions and data, making it a common target of attacks
    buffer overflow
      - involves a program writing more data to a buffer than it can hold, introducing a vulnerability
    memory injection
      - involves injecting malicious code into a systems memory
    race condition    
      - weakness occurs when multiple processes or threads try to access a system at once
      - Time of check (TOC), Time of use (TOU)
    malicious update
      - involves altering software or firmware with harmful code via an update that appears legitimate

Operating Sysem (OS)-based vulnerabilities
  - result from improper configuration, outdated components, and design flaws
  mitigation strategies
    - regular OS updates and patch management
    - principle of least privilege
    - robust monitoring
    - logging

web-based vulnerabilities
  - weakness in web applications and services
  structured query language injection (SQLi)
    - vulnerabilities are flaws that attackers can use to manipulate SQL queries in web applications
  cross-site scripting (XSS)
    - vulnerabilities enable the injection of malicious scripts into web pages

hardware vulnerabilities
  - involve the exploitable weaknesses of a system's physical devices and components
  firmware vulnerabilities
    - weaknesses are in the software that manages hardware functions
  end-of-life (EOL) hardware
    - no longer receives essential security updates from the vendor
  legacy hardware 
    - is no longer supported by its vendor at all

virtualization techonlogy
  - creation of virtual instances of physical hardware. vulnerabilities may lead to unauthorized use of virtual resources.
  virtual machine (VM) escape
    - occurs when an attacker breaks out of a virtual machine to access the host system
  resource reuse
    - involves sharing physical resources among multiple virtual instances. it introduces the risk of data leaks between virtual environments.

cloud specific
  - cloud offers various on-demand services to extend computer capabilities
    - software as a servie (SaaS)
    - infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
    - Platform as a service (PaaS)
    - Security as a service (SECaaS)
