# Vulnerabilities

## Application Layer
- **Gateway to user interactions and data**, making it a common target of attacks.
  - **Buffer overflow**: involves a program writing more data to a buffer than it can hold, introducing a vulnerability.
  - **Memory injection**: involves injecting malicious code into a system's memory.
  - **Race condition**: occurs when multiple processes or threads try to access a system at once.
    - Time of Check (TOC), Time of Use (TOU)
  - **Malicious update**: involves altering software or firmware with harmful code via an update that appears legitimate.

## Operating System (OS)-based Vulnerabilities
- Result from improper configuration, outdated components, and design flaws.
  - **Mitigation strategies**:
    - Regular OS updates and patch management.
    - Principle of least privilege.
    - Robust monitoring and logging.

## Web-based Vulnerabilities
- Weaknesses in web applications and services.
  - **Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi)**: vulnerabilities that allow attackers to manipulate SQL queries in web applications.
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: vulnerabilities that enable the injection of malicious scripts into web pages.

## Hardware Vulnerabilities
- Involve the exploitable weaknesses of a system's physical devices and components.
  - **Firmware vulnerabilities**: weaknesses in the software that manages hardware functions.
  - **End-of-life (EOL) hardware**: no longer receives essential security updates from the vendor.
  - **Legacy hardware**: no longer supported by its vendor at all.

## Virtualization Technology
- Creation of virtual instances of physical hardware may lead to unauthorized use of virtual resources.
  - **Virtual machine (VM) escape**: occurs when an attacker breaks out of a virtual machine to access the host system.
  - **Resource reuse**: involves sharing physical resources among multiple virtual instances, introducing the risk of data leaks between virtual environments.

## Cloud Specific
- Cloud offers various on-demand services to extend computing capabilities:
  - **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: cloud service provides the IaaS, PaaS, and the software.
  - **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: cloud service provides the IaaS and the OS.
  - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: cloud service provides the hardware, SD hardware, virtualization, or the network.
  - **Security as a Service (SECaaS)**: cloud service provider (CSP) provides remote cybersecurity and IT.

### Cloud Environments
- **Public**: applications and storage are offered to the general public over the internet, such as free web email services and scalable pay-as-you-go business services.
- **Private**: designed for a particular organization, giving the security administrator some control over data and infrastructure. Resources could come from the organization itself or a third party.
- **Hybrid**: mixing elements of public and private clouds, hybrid environments use servers from the organization and the cloud. Confidential data is typically kept in-house.
- **Community**: a mix of public/private, where multiple organizations can share the public portion.

### Cloud Security Concerns
- Lack of privacy
- Lack of accountability
- Improper authentication
- Data recovery problems

### Mitigation Strategies
- Strict access policies
- Strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Encryption
- Documentation of stored items

## Social Media Security
- Users post information that could compromise security.
- Difficult to track all social media platforms and applications; consider using allow lists and deny lists.

## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks
- Used for file sharing, gaming, and streaming media.
- Potential for malware and system infiltration.

## Dark Web
- A P2P system popular for facilitating illegal activities.
- Employees might connect cloud resources, so auditing is important.
- Directly monitoring the dark web can introduce risk; monitoring can be outsourced.

## Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
- **Service provider vulnerabilities**: a service provider's breaches or weaknesses can impact organizational security.
- **Hardware provider vulnerabilities**: counterfeit components, compromised firmware, tampering.
- **Software provider vulnerabilities**: weaknesses in products or services, varied vulnerabilities such as coding errors or malicious insertions.

## Cryptographic Vulnerabilities
- Weaknesses in encryption and decryption, such as outdated algorithms, weak keys, or flawed implementations.
  - **Mitigation strategies**:
    - Select proper cryptographic standards.
    - Update regularly.

## Misconfiguration
- Incorrect setup of software, hardware, or networks can lead to unauthorized access or the exposure of sensitive information.
  - **Mitigation strategies**:
    - Regular systems audits.
    - Using documented configuration standards.
    - Using automated configuration management tools.

## Mobile Device Vulnerabilities
- **Side loading**: installing applications from sources outside the official app store.
  - **Mitigation**:
    - Device policies
    - User education
- **Jailbreaking**: removing restrictions imposed by the manufacturer or carrier.
  - **Mitigation**:
    - Device policies
    - User education
    - Jailbreaking detection

## Zero-day Vulnerabilities
- A flaw that is disclosed before its patch is released.
  - **Zero-day protection**:
    - Use a new OS with built-in protections.
    - Use multiple firewall layers.
    - Use approved application lists.
    - Install updates/patches regularly.
