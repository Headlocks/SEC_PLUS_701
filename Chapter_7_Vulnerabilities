Application Layer
  - is a gateway to user interactions and data, making it a common target of attacks
    buffer overflow
      - involves a program writing more data to a buffer than it can hold, introducing a vulnerability
    memory injection
      - involves injecting malicious code into a systems memory
    race condition    
      - weakness occurs when multiple processes or threads try to access a system at once
      - Time of check (TOC), Time of use (TOU)
    malicious update
      - involves altering software or firmware with harmful code via an update that appears legitimate

Operating Sysem (OS)-based vulnerabilities
  - result from improper configuration, outdated components, and design flaws
  mitigation strategies
    - regular OS updates and patch management
    - principle of least privilege
    - robust monitoring
    - logging

web-based vulnerabilities
  - weakness in web applications and services
  structured query language injection (SQLi)
    - vulnerabilities are flaws that attackers can use to manipulate SQL queries in web applications
  cross-site scripting (XSS)
    - vulnerabilities enable the injection of malicious scripts into web pages

hardware vulnerabilities
  - involve the exploitable weaknesses of a system's physical devices and components
  firmware vulnerabilities
    - weaknesses are in the software that manages hardware functions
  end-of-life (EOL) hardware
    - no longer receives essential security updates from the vendor
  legacy hardware 
    - is no longer supported by its vendor at all

virtualization techonlogy
  - creation of virtual instances of physical hardware. vulnerabilities may lead to unauthorized use of virtual resources.
  virtual machine (VM) escape
    - occurs when an attacker breaks out of a virtual machine to access the host system
  resource reuse
    - involves sharing physical resources among multiple virtual instances. it introduces the risk of data leaks between virtual environments.

cloud specific
  - cloud offers various on-demand services to extend computer capabilities
    - Platform as a service (PaaS)
      - cloud service provides the IaaS, PaaS, and the software
    - Software as a servie (SaaS)
      - cloud service provides the IaaS and the OS.
    - Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
      - cloud service provides the hardware, sd hardware, virtualization, or the network
    - Security as a service (SECaaS)
      - cloud service provider (CSP), provides remote cyber security and IT
Cloud Specific
  - cloud environments may be public, private, hybrid, or community
  public
    - applications and storage are offered to the general public over the internet. examples are free web email services and scalable pay-as-you-go business services
  private
    - designed for a particular organization and gives the security administrator some control over data and infrastructure. resources could come from the organization itself or a third party.
  hybrid
    - mixing elements of public and private clouds, hybrid environments user servers from the organization and the cloud. confidential data is typically kept in-house
  community 
    - public/private mix, multiple organizations can share the public portion
Cloud Specific
  cloud security concerns
    - lack of privacy
    - lack of accountability
    - improper authentication
    - data recovery problems
  mitigation
    - strict access policies
    - strong passwords and MFA
    - encryption
    - documentation of stored items
  social media security
    - users post information that could compromise security
    - difficult to track all social media platforms and applications; consider using allow lists and deny lists
  peer-to-peer (P2P) networks
    - used for file sharing, gaming, and streming media
    - potential for malware and system infiltration
  dark web
    - a P2P system popular for facilitating illegal activities
    - employees might connect cloud resources, so auditing is important
    - directly monitoring the dark web can introduce risk. monitoring can be outsourced.

Supply Chain
  service provider vulnrabilities
    - a service providers breaches or weaknesses can impact organizational security
  hardware provider vulnerablities
    - counterfeit components
    - compromised firmware
    - tampering
  software provider vulnerabilties
    - weaknesses in products or services
    - varied vulnerabilities such as coding errors or malicious insertions

cryptographic vulnerabilities
  - weaknesses in encryption and decryption. they could involve outdated algorithms, weak keys, or flaw implementations
  mitigation
    - select proper cryptographic standards
    - update regularly

misconfiguration
  - is the incorrect setup of software, hardware, or networks. it can lead to unauthorized access or the exposure of sensitive information.
  mitigation strategies
    - regular systems audits
    - using documented configuration standards
    - using automated configuration management tools

mobile device
  side loading
    - installing applications from sources outside the official app store
    mitigation
      - device policies
      - user education
  jailbreaking
    - refers to removing restrictions imposed by the manufacturer or carrier
    mitigation
      - device policies
      - user education
      - jailbreaking detection

zero-day vulnerabilities
  - is a flaw thats disclosed before its patch is released
  zero-day protection
    - is a collective term for the related preventative measures:
      - use a new OS with built-in protections
      - use multiple firewall layers
      - use approved application lists
      - install updates/patches regularly
