## Chapter 27: Understanding the Types and Purposes of Audits and Assessments

attestation
  - formal act of affirming or certifying validity of a process, system, or a data set
    - adds trust and integrity to an organization's cybersecurity posture
    - confirms that specific security controls are in place and functioning as intended
    - often takes the form of signed statements or digital certificates

attestation process
  - 1) evaluataion
  - 2) documentation
  - 3) approval
  - 4) issuance
  - 5) review and update

internal
  - self-audits conducted internally by the organization to ensure alignment with external requirements and internal policies
    - proactive
    - self-assessments
      - are audits conducted by staff responsible for the assessed areas
    - internal compliance audits
      - are overseen by internal committees

compliance audit
  - define scope
    - identify the applicable laws, regulations, and policies
  - gather data
    - collect evidence such as logs configurations, and employee interviews
  - analyze
    - evaluate data against the defined scope
  - report
    - document findings, including non-compliance, and recommend corrective actions

internal audit committee
  - oversight body comprised of senior management and subject matter experts
    -responsibilities
      - audit planning
      - review
      - oversight
      - accountability

external
  - evaluations conducted by entities outside the organization
    - regulatory audit
      - mandated by law or industry standards
    - independent third-party audit
      - conducted by an unbiased organization
    - examination
      - verifies specific claims or compliance assertions
    - assessment
      - evaluates the overall security posture

penetration testing
  - diagnostic tool to assess cybersecurity by simulating cyberattacks
    - proactively identifies vulnerabilities and evaluates the effectiveness of defensive mechanisms
    - helps organizations meet compliance requirements

penetration testing lifecycle
  - 1) Planning
  - 2) Reconnaissance
  - 3) Scanning
  - 4) Gaining Access
  - 5) Maintaining Access
  - 6) Analysis and Reporting

types of penetration tests
  - physical penetration testing
    - targets physical barriers such as door locks and surveillance systems
  - offensive penetration testing (red teaming)
    - mimics the actions of threat actors to identify vulnerabilities
  - defensive penetration testing (blue teaming)
    - focuses on managing simulated attacks to evaluate defensive strategies
  - integrated penetration testing (purple teaming)
    - combines offensive and defensive methodologies
  - known environment penetration testing (white box testing)
    - testers have comprehensive information about the system's architecture
  - partially known environment penetration testing (gray box testing)
    - testers have a subset of system information
  - unknown environment penetration testing (black box testing)
    - testers have no knowledge of the system's architecture

reconnaissance
  - collecting preliminary data or intelligence about the target
    - passive reconnaissance
      - low-profile approach to gathering information
      - identifies potential vulnerabilities or areas of interest without alerting the target
    - active reconnaissance
      - involves direct interaction with the target system; may target intrusion detection systems
      - provides more detail about system vulnerabilities
