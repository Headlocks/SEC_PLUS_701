## Chapter 27: Understanding the Types and Purposes of Audits and Assessments

### Attestation
- Formal act of affirming or certifying validity of a process, system, or a data set
  - Adds trust and integrity to an organization's cybersecurity posture
  - Confirms that specific security controls are in place and functioning as intended
  - Often takes the form of signed statements or digital certificates

#### Attestation Process
1. Evaluation
2. Documentation
3. Approval
4. Issuance
5. Review and Update

### Internal
- Self-audits conducted internally by the organization to ensure alignment with external requirements and internal policies
  - Proactive
  - Self-assessments
    - Audits conducted by staff responsible for the assessed areas
  - Internal compliance audits
    - Overseen by internal committees

### Compliance Audit
- Define scope
  - Identify the applicable laws, regulations, and policies
- Gather data
  - Collect evidence such as logs, configurations, and employee interviews
- Analyze
  - Evaluate data against the defined scope
- Report
  - Document findings, including non-compliance, and recommend corrective actions

### Internal Audit Committee
- Oversight body comprised of senior management and subject matter experts
  - Responsibilities
    - Audit planning
    - Review
    - Oversight
    - Accountability

### External
- Evaluations conducted by entities outside the organization
  - Regulatory audit
    - Mandated by law or industry standards
  - Independent third-party audit
    - Conducted by an unbiased organization
  - Examination
    - Verifies specific claims or compliance assertions
  - Assessment
    - Evaluates the overall security posture

### Penetration Testing
- Diagnostic tool to assess cybersecurity by simulating cyberattacks
  - Proactively identifies vulnerabilities and evaluates the effectiveness of defensive mechanisms
  - Helps organizations meet compliance requirements

#### Penetration Testing Lifecycle
1. Planning
2. Reconnaissance
3. Scanning
4. Gaining Access
5. Maintaining Access
6. Analysis and Reporting

### Types of Penetration Tests
- Physical penetration testing
  - Targets physical barriers such as door locks and surveillance systems
- Offensive penetration testing (red teaming)
  - Mimics the actions of threat actors to identify vulnerabilities
- Defensive penetration testing (blue teaming)
  - Focuses on managing simulated attacks to evaluate defensive strategies
- Integrated penetration testing (purple teaming)
  - Combines offensive and defensive methodologies
- Known environment penetration testing (white box testing)
  - Testers have comprehensive information about the system's architecture
- Partially known environment penetration testing (gray box testing)
  - Testers have a subset of system information
- Unknown environment penetration testing (black box testing)
  - Testers have no knowledge of the system's architecture

### Reconnaissance
- Collecting preliminary data or intelligence about the target
  - Passive reconnaissance
    - Low-profile approach to gathering information
    - Identifies potential vulnerabilities or areas of interest without alerting the target
  - Active reconnaissance
    - Involves direct interaction with the target system; may target intrusion detection systems
    - Provides more detail about system vulnerabilities
