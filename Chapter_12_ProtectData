## Chapter 12: Protect Data

### Data Types
- Regulated Data
  - subject to laws and regulations due to sensitivity, such as medical records regulated by HIPAA
- Trade Secret
  - confidential information providing a competitive advantage, like a proprietary algorithm
- Intellectual Property (IP) 
  - protected creative works, inventions, and designs, including copyrighted source code
- Legal Information
  - data related to legal processes or obligations, such as signed contracts or employee agreements
- Financial Information
  - data concerning financial operations and performance, regulated by laws like SOX and GLBA, including balance sheets, income statements, and tax records
- Human- and Non-Human-Readable Data
  - human-readable data (text documents)
  - non-human-readable data (encrypted files)

### Data Classifications
- Confidential or Proprietary
  - information or assets that could cause grave damage to an organization if accessed without authorization
- Sensitive
  - data that could cause some damage to an organization if accessed without authorization
- Public
  - information openly available without causing harm or presenting risks if exposed
- Private
  - information or assets that could cause severe damage to an organization if accessed without authorization (e.g., Payroll Data)
- Restricted
  - data requiring the highest level of security measures due to its sensitive nature or stringent legal obligations
- Critical
  - data essential to the continued function of a business, the loss of which would result in significant monetary loss for the organization

### General Data Considerations
- Data States
  - the states in which data exists: at rest, in transit, and in use
- Handling Procedures
  - establish clear procedures for handling data throughout its lifecycle, from creation and storage to sharing and disposal
- Security Measures
  - implement robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, monitoring, and incident response protocols to help safeguard data against unauthorized access, breaches, and other threats

### Data Sovereignty & Geolocation
- Data Sovereignty
  - legal and regulatory requirements for data based on its collection or processing locations
  - mandates often dictate that data must remain within a country's borders
- Geolocation
  - identification or estimation of real-world geographic location based on digital information
  - uses technologies like GPS tagging, geofencing, and IP-based location services

### Methods to Secure Data
- Geographic Restriction
  - limits access to data based on user's geographic location
- Encryption 
  - converts readable data to an encoded format
- Hashing
  - converts data to fixed-length strings for verifying integrity
- Masking
  - replaces specific data with fictitious but structurally similar data
- Tokenization
  - replaces sensitive information with a placeholder, reducing the risk of data breaches
- Obfuscation
  - makes data unintelligible without affecting functionality

### Segmentation
- Divides a network into segments that isolate data
  - Examples:
    - Finance Segment
      - highly secure area of the network for sensitive financial information
    - Firewall Segment
      - also known as a screened subnet; a buffer zone between the external network (internet) and internal network
    - Engineering Segment
      - isolated environment for development and testing purposes
    - Sales Segment
      - for customer relationship management (CRM) systems, sales records, and customer-related data

### Permission Restrictions
- Specify who can perform which actions within a system or network
  - Methods:
    - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
      - access permissions are assigned to organizational roles
    - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
      - access is granted based on attributes like location, time, or device type
    - Principle of Least Privilege
      - ensures that users have only the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks
