## Chapter 12: Protect Data

Data Types
  - Regulated Data
    - subject to laws and regulations due to sensitivity, such as medical records regulated by HIPAA
  - trade secret
    - confidential information providing a competitive advantage, like a proprietary algorithm
  - intellectual property (IP) 
    - protected creative works, inventions, and designs, including copyrighted source code
  - legal information
    - data related to legal processes or obligations, such as signed contracts or employee agreements
  - financial information
    - data concerning financial operations and performance, regulated by laws like SOX and GLBA, including balance sheets, income statements, and a tax records
  - human- and non-human-readable data
    - human-readable data (text documents)
    - non-human-readable data (encrypted files)

Data Classifications
  - confidential or proprietary
    - information or assets that could cause grave damage to an organization if accessed without authorization
  - sensitive
    - data that could cause some damage to an organization if accessed without authorization
  - public
    - information openly available without causing harm or presenting risks if exposed
  - private
    - information or assets that could cause sever damage to an organization if accessed without authorization (Payroll Data)
  - Restricted
    - data requiring the highest level of security measures due to its sensitive nature or stringent legal obligations
  - critical
    - data essential to the continued function of a business, the lost of which would result in significant monetary loss for the organization

General Data Considerations
  - Data States
    - the states in which data exists: at rest, in transit, and in use
  - handling procedures
    - establish clear procedures for handling data throughout its lifecycle, from creation and storage to sharing and disposal
  - security measures
    - implement robust security measures, including encryption, access controls, monitoring, and incident response protocols to help safeguard data against unauthorized access, breaches, and other security threats

Data Sovereignty & Geolocation
  - Data Sovereignty
    - legal and regulatory requirements for data bsaed on its collection or processing locations
    - mandatse often dictate that data must remain within a country's borders
  - Geolocation
    - identification or estimation of real-world geographic location based on digital information
    - uses technologies like GPS tagging, geofencing, and IP-based location services

Methods to Secure Data
  - geographic restriction
    - limits access to data based on user's geographic location
  - encryption 
    - converts readable data to an encoded format
  - hashing
    - converts data to fixed-length strings for verifying integrity
  - masking
    - replaces specific data with fictitious but structurally similar data
  - tokenization
    - replaces sensitive information with a placeholder, reducing the risk of data breaches
  - obfuscation
    - makes data unintelligible without affecting functionality

segmentation
  - divides a network into segments that isolate data
  examples
    - finance segment
      - highly secure area of the network for sensitive financial information
    - firewall segment
      - also known as a screened subnet; a buffer zone between the external network (internet) and internal network
    - engineering segment
      - isolated environment for development and testing purposes
    - sales segment
      - for customer relationship management (CRM) systems, sales records, and customer-related data

Permission Restrictions
  - specify who can perform which actions within a system or network
    methods
      - role-based access control (RBAC)
        - access permissions are assigned to organizational roles
      - Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
        - access is granted based on attributes like location, time, or device type
      - principle of least privilege
        - ensures that users have only the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks
